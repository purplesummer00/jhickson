I'm sorry I didn't accept this earlier, I had no idea you requested. You can DM me any time you'd like to talk üòÉ

[19-Feb-17 01:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
It's all good!

[19-Feb-17 01:19 AM] josh#8811
Cool üòÑ

Just one more thing before I go to bed

[19-Feb-17 01:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Did you guys conclude what happened or is there still some stuff that needs to be addressed?

[19-Feb-17 01:22 AM] josh#8811
I totally wrecked John by confronting him about what he said and he threatened to cut himself if I released any posts (idk if you were online then), and then we told him what he did wrong with Lourdes. H took it quite well, and he still needs to resolve stuff with me but otherwise I think everything was resolved

[19-Feb-17 01:23 AM] josh#8811
I feel really guilty about it still, but I keep reading the chat logs and he said a lot of mean things

[19-Feb-17 01:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay; please don't feel super guilty about that. Holly did the exact same thing with me and it's just to get out of trouble. He is obviously not the best person and I guess we will just have to take it day by day

[19-Feb-17 01:25 AM] josh#8811
Thanks, I reminded myself about what happened to you when that happened. It really freaked me out, and idk if I can talk to him anymore

[19-Feb-17 01:26 AM] josh#8811
Day by day is a good strategy

[19-Feb-17 01:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
That's completely understandable

[19-Feb-17 01:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm happy you agree with that. Tomorrow will be a happy day and we will have an entire week to relax üòä

[19-Feb-17 01:27 AM] josh#8811
Aw yeah, forgot about that üòÉ

[19-Feb-17 01:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yup, it's really nice!

[19-Feb-17 01:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm gonna go to bed now, goodnight. I hope you feel less stressed now that the conversation is over

[19-Feb-17 01:28 AM] josh#8811
Thanks, goodnight Hannah

Please come back on, friend. We are about to watch the movie

Hi I'm home now, might take a while to settle in

You look upset

Idk I don't want to draw attention but M is really putting some stress on me

[09-Mar-17 05:45 PM] josh#8811
I don't want to whine but... Idk

[09-Mar-17 05:45 PM] josh#8811
We worked so hard to solve this

[09-Mar-17 05:45 PM] josh#8811
It's going to happen again

[09-Mar-17 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm so sorry

[09-Mar-17 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't know what I can do right now

Please, you don't have to worry

[09-Mar-17 05:47 PM] josh#8811

Are you doing ok?

[09-Mar-17 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't know. My mom dumped a lot of stuff on me during the meeting and then seeing you and other people upset made me feel even more upset

[09-Mar-17 05:49 PM] josh#8811
Oh jeez, I'm really sorry to hear that

[09-Mar-17 05:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wish that there was an easy solution to this

[09-Mar-17 05:50 PM] josh#8811
Do you have schoolwork or something she dumped?

My brother is going through a wave of depression

[09-Mar-17 05:50 PM] josh#8811
Oh no

[09-Mar-17 05:50 PM] josh#8811
Is he doing ok?

[09-Mar-17 05:51 PM] josh#8811
How bad is it?

[09-Mar-17 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah he has no intentions of harming himself but he doesn't eat dinner and he never talks to anyone

[09-Mar-17 05:52 PM] josh#8811
Oh man

[09-Mar-17 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't want to worry you and make things worse

[09-Mar-17 05:52 PM] josh#8811
That's not too bad but any depression is not good

[09-Mar-17 05:52 PM] josh#8811
No, it's ok

[21-Mar-17 07:27 PM] josh#8811
Hi, we're going to pick you up tomorrow morning around 6:45, then we'll head to Shawn's house to pick him up too. I looked up how long it would take on Google Maps, and it looks like we'll arrive around 7:05 or earlier if we leave around 6:37-40 to pick you up (https://goo.gl/maps/9gwsnXS927E2). See you tomorrow!

Hey could you talk to me about what happened with maddie? Spencer let me know about it

[11-May-17 06:58 PM] josh#8811
yeah sure, i'll type it out for ya

[11-May-17 07:01 PM] josh#8811
Ok, so basically when I was teasing Maddie behind the door in Mr. Small's during lunch apparently she heard you say "fucking bitch" or something, and she got really mad about it for the next couple of hours. Apparently other people heard it too, but I didn't hear it. She vented about it to me during mentor time and she said something along the lines of "She (you) shouldn't have said it behind a closed door; that's like being a coward." Again, I didn't hear you say anything because my focus was on Maddie at that moment.

[11-May-17 07:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Honestly I didn't say anything. I don't swear at all and the entire time I was talking to Jessica

[11-May-17 07:02 PM] josh#8811
I know, it seemed really off

[11-May-17 07:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
She makes me so upset sometimes

[11-May-17 07:02 PM] josh#8811
she assumed it was you because there were only 2 other girls in the room and she thought you said that for some reason

[11-May-17 07:02 PM] josh#8811
i'm really sorry

[11-May-17 07:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can I say something mean

[11-May-17 07:03 PM] josh#8811
yeah sure, let it out

[11-May-17 07:04 PM] josh#8811
oh crap i gotta go

[11-May-17 07:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
She is so up in her head, she thinks everything is about her. And even if I did say that, it is so minuscule compared to what she did to me

[11-May-17 07:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay I'll talk to you later

[20-May-17 12:51 PM] josh#8811

I know how it feels to not belong in a group of people. I promise that people care about you though-I care about you. Please know that I will always be here if you have anything you need to get out. It doesn't matter how big or small it is, if something's on your mind, I want to help. You are not a waste of space, you so important to many people. I don't want you to feel as if you had no one to go to when you are feeling down.

[19-Sep-17 08:34 PM] josh#8811
Thank you very much for your kindness. I am very grateful to be your friend and I am very sorry if I am worrying you. I'll try to work things out

That's pretty great that he's learning life skills and stuff

[07-Nov-17 03:19 PM] josh#8811
I hope so too; I'm pretty sure that it will work too, if it works with your mom

[07-Nov-17 03:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that‚Äôs what the psychiatrist said

[07-Nov-17 03:28 PM] josh#8811
Yay :)

[07-Nov-17 09:07 PM] josh#8811
did your psychiatrist prescribe to you both lexapro and hydroxyzine?

[07-Nov-17 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes

[07-Nov-17 09:10 PM] josh#8811
okay, cool. I was trying to see online if the drugs would interfere with each other, and it looks like there's really not much interference unless you have any sort of cardiac disease; just wanted to make sure that it wouldn't cause any problems (i found that info here: <https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/hydroxyzine-with-lexapro-1303-0-1013-565.html>)

I do not have a cardiac disease but thanks for looking

im glad that you got some drugs, it looks like hydroxyzine works pretty well

it might be good to help you fall asleep, but it doesnt sound fun having it at school

[07-Nov-17 09:13 PM] josh#8811
is there anything i can do to help you through this? i want to make sure that you're on to a really speedy recovery

[07-Nov-17 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would say make sure I‚Äôm not a hermit üòÇ I  tend to shy away from conversations but I think talking will help. But don‚Äôt worry too much because I‚Äôm getting a 504 plan which will allow me to have decompression time during class

[07-Nov-17 09:16 PM] josh#8811
that's great that you're getting a 504! I'll do my best to talk to you more often (sometimes I have a bit of a problem doing that too haha)

[07-Nov-17 09:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah and hopefully the medicine starts kicking in and doing it‚Äôs job. I strongly believe that once I have the medicine in full effect I‚Äôll start feeling better. It‚Äôs just a sucky transition period right now. And I‚Äôll try my best to be more social, I just get really panicky in loud, large groups.

[07-Nov-17 09:20 PM] josh#8811
I know that you'll feel a lot better too, you just gotta power through these next couple of weeks. You got this! I don't blame you with the loud large groups, I understand why they could be panic inducing

[07-Nov-17 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thank you! I need to keep reminding myself of good things, I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of just feeding into the sadness. Now that I think about it, I‚Äôve already noticed that I‚Äôve been getting a little better

[07-Nov-17 09:22 PM] josh#8811
I'm very glad that you're feeling better! I tend to feed into the sadness as well haha, it's a bit of a bad 'habit'

[07-Nov-17 09:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I mean I was able to stop myself from having a full on panic attack today

[07-Nov-17 09:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is completely random, but something weird that the psychiatrist pointed out is that I have a bit of ocd

[07-Nov-17 09:24 PM] josh#8811
That's a good improvement! You're climbing up üòÉ

that's pretty interesting

[07-Nov-17 09:25 PM] josh#8811
i don't know much about ocd, but is it a cleanliness thing or more of a pattern thing?

[07-Nov-17 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, so what I do is I count my steps and I have to step a certain amount of times in each square. And if I start with my left foot, I need to start with my left foot in every square. Same with my right

[07-Nov-17 09:27 PM] josh#8811
woah

[07-Nov-17 09:27 PM] josh#8811
that is pretty ocd

[07-Nov-17 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs really weird. I never thought about it much until she pointed it out

[07-Nov-17 09:28 PM] josh#8811
hmm

[07-Nov-17 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
But the medication helps that as well

[07-Nov-17 09:29 PM] josh#8811
I hear that serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs, such as the lexapro or Fluvoxamine help with ocd, yea

I hope so too, I'm really rooting for you

[11-Nov-17 10:04 AM] josh#8811
I'm not sure if this is a rude question to ask; does Spencer know how to help you through a panic attack on the off-chance that Ivonne isn't there?

[11-Nov-17 10:05 AM] josh#8811
I want to make sure that you have a lot of people that know how to help you through it

[11-Nov-17 10:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
I tried telling him different things to do and ivonne talked to him, but I think he freaks out in the moment

[11-Nov-17 10:07 AM] josh#8811
Man, I'm sorry that happens when you're going through that; I really hope he can push himself to help you through it eventually and I understand why he may feel like that

[11-Nov-17 10:09 AM] josh#8811
I asked Ivonne last night how I can help you through an attack, and I tried to memorize the steps she'd take; hopefully, if Ivonne isn't able to help, I can try to help guide Spencer through it and / or do my best to help you when you're feeling bad

[11-Nov-17 10:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
I really appreciate that josh. Having someone there really helps me and I‚Äôm sure Spencer will eventually catch on and know what to do

[11-Nov-17 10:11 AM] josh#8811
Thank you, I'm really glad to be here and I will do my best to help you feel better and help Spencer know how to help you too

[11-Nov-17 10:12 AM] josh#8811
Did he try to help when you had your last panic attack?

[11-Nov-17 10:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt really know. I tried telling him to give me space. It‚Äôs just that one was so bad, I couldnt speak

[11-Nov-17 10:13 AM] josh#8811
Oh gosh, that sounds very hard to go through

[11-Nov-17 10:13 AM] josh#8811
I'm so sorry

[11-Nov-17 10:14 AM] josh#8811
It helps when you have space from people?

[11-Nov-17 10:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, being crowded makes it worse, I feel extremely claustrophobic. But once my breathing calms down I don‚Äôt mind being asked a few questions

[11-Nov-17 10:16 AM] josh#8811
Gosh, that sounds very intense. I heard that it's good for you to be able to concentrate on your breathing by bringing your legs against your chest

[11-Nov-17 10:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes that helps

[11-Nov-17 10:18 AM] josh#8811
That's good to know

How are things going with Spencer in general, if I may ask?

[11-Nov-17 10:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well I would say we are doing good, the only issue is my mental health, as it is really stressing him out.

[11-Nov-17 10:21 AM] josh#8811
That's good that you guys are doing well; I'm sorry to hear that he's stressed from your mental health

[11-Nov-17 10:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
He just hates seeing me upset. I mean, it‚Äôs probably really hard seeing the person you care about going through panic attacks and depressive bouts

[11-Nov-17 10:27 AM] josh#8811
Man, I'm so sorry that you guys are having to deal with this. It sounds very hard seeing someone you really care about going through something like this, and it's even worse that you have to experience it. I feel my gut wrench every time I see you having a panic attack, and I'm sure he feels either the same or even worse. I wish that this could all be solved with the push of a button....

[11-Nov-17 10:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Me too. If only it was a switch I could turn off. It is so scary and emotionally draining. This really sucks

I'm so sorry Hannah

She seems to be the only one who can get me through a panic attack as comfortably as possible so far. But I know I shouldn‚Äôt only rely on her as she won‚Äôt always be there

[11-Nov-17 10:38 AM] josh#8811
That's true, she won't always be here

[11-Nov-17 10:39 AM] josh#8811
Sometimes I wonder how she is able to help you through it like she does

When I first saw you, I really wasn't sure what I could do to help you through it; I did start to approach you but Ivonne gestured me to give you space

Hey, this might be a little abrupt, but I just learned that I don't have to come into my job at the music school until 12:30 today (I came in for a rehearsal for an event this morning and someone is covering for me until 12:30, so I'm just hanging out at the shopping center), would you be up for maybe just walking around and hanging out?

[18-Nov-17 10:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm at the movie theater right now, but maybe later?

[18-Nov-17 10:44 AM] josh#8811

Oh hey, how was Thor? Was it as 80s themed as the trailer? lol

[18-Nov-17 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thor was pretty good! I love how they always tie in other marvel characters in the movies. There were a few things my brother and Dad didn‚Äôt like but overall it was great

[18-Nov-17 02:53 PM] josh#8811
That sounds fun! I'm glad you guys had a good time üòÉ

[18-Nov-17 02:56 PM] josh#8811
At first my day went pretty well, but then I googled my uncle to find some of his films he made, and I kind of learned something really horrible. I said what happened in detail in #campfire, I'm sorry that I don't really feel like typing it out again

Oh dear, I think I saw little snippets of that when I got the notification. I sure it was rough, I‚Äôm sorry üòï

It's alright

I usually go for the coffee Frappuccino, or my new favorite: the chestnut praline latte, but I just went for an iced tea because it is too late in the day for caffeine

do you like quinoa? i know how to steam it, and it's pretty high in protein. i'm sure there are a lot of good recipes out there for it too, it could be a good option

Yeah, I always find it funny when people ask me what I eat. There are so many things I can eat for meals

[19-Nov-17 07:19 PM] josh#8811
haha, i bet you can get asked pretty often

[19-Nov-17 07:20 PM] josh#8811
it's just pretty hard for me to wrap my head around going vegan, since i myself like eating meat

[19-Nov-17 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
And that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs so easy and natural for me since I‚Äôve been vegan since 2nd grade

[19-Nov-17 07:21 PM] josh#8811
wow, that's a long time! and that's really great that it's easy for you too üòÉ

Totally! Although I have fallen off the wagon once or twice, I have learned my lesson. I honestly can‚Äôt see myself going back

A few years ago I ate a donut. I had the worst stomach cramps, it sucked. So I said never again

[19-Nov-17 07:23 PM] josh#8811
oh man!

[19-Nov-17 07:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal, but I was in a lot of pain. I really don‚Äôt want to experience that ever again so I‚Äôve learned my lesson

[19-Nov-17 07:25 PM] josh#8811
man, that sounds pretty painful. i dont blame you for staying vegan after that!

[19-Nov-17 07:25 PM] josh#8811
maybe you're lactose intolerant? it's pretty unnatural for us humans to be drinking cows milk

[19-Nov-17 07:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I probably am now, as my stomach doesn‚Äôt create the acids necessary to dissolve animal products. That‚Äôs why it hurt so much

[19-Nov-17 07:26 PM] josh#8811
Man :(

[19-Nov-17 07:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it‚Äôs okay because I am perfectly happy with it! I have no desire to fall off the wagon

[19-Nov-17 07:28 PM] josh#8811
That's really good that you don't! I imagine that it would be very hard for you to go back to eating animal products

[19-Nov-17 07:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
For sure, I don‚Äôt regret it

No, as cats are carnivores and the dogs are omnivores

[19-Nov-17 07:30 PM] josh#8811
Ah, I see

[19-Nov-17 07:30 PM] josh#8811
I heard about vegan pet food once or twice but I'm not sure if it was a real thing or not

[19-Nov-17 07:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs not healthy for the animals, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to have to keep giving them vitamin pills

That's true, yeah. It sounds very cumbersome and unhealthy

Hi Hannah, I found a couple of recipes that might work out for tonight. Do you like walnuts? My mother found this "Skillet Wild Rice, Walnut and Broccoli Salad" recipe that we could use, and replace the wild rice with quinoa. Is there any recipe that you have in mind? My mothers going to go to the grocery store soon

[21-Nov-17 10:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Let me see what my mom has in mind. I already have mashed potatoes, so I could probably have plain quinoa instead of something fancy

Okay, that's cool üëç

Don‚Äôt worry I will. What are you up to today?

[22-Nov-17 10:30 AM] josh#8811
I'm just going to be working with my mom a little bit, and during the afternoon/evening I think I'm not doing anything. How about you?

[22-Nov-17 10:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sounds fun, I‚Äôm just babysitting and resting today

Yeah. Can I tell you what‚Äôs been causing my stress and anxiety?

Yes, I would like to know

Okay here it goes. I‚Äôm going to break up with Spencer

[22-Nov-17 10:32 AM] josh#8811
Oh wow, that must be very stressful

[22-Nov-17 10:32 AM] josh#8811
Gosh

Thank you for telling me

[22-Nov-17 10:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Of course. And yeah it is pretty stressful. Luckily my mom is willing to help me through it

[22-Nov-17 10:34 AM] josh#8811
I'm kinda at a loss for words, but I will do everything I can to help you through this as well, whatever that may be. You have my full support

Thank you üòä I‚Äôm just not happy with him anymore. It‚Äôs just how I‚Äôm gonna go about this that worries me

[22-Nov-17 10:36 AM] josh#8811
That worries me too, I don't want anything bad to result from it. It's no problem üòä

[22-Nov-17 10:36 AM] josh#8811
Are you planning to do it over the break?

No matter how he reacts we are here to love you and protect you

Probably the next time I see him. I‚Äôm just soooo nervous because Im afraid he is going to guilt trip me again. And I really appreciate that josh ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[22-Nov-17 10:38 AM] josh#8811
I care about you a lot, it's no problem :)
He guilt trips you??

Absolutely

Okay. I‚Äôm just saying this has to be 100% confidential

Don't worry

[22-Nov-17 10:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
There was a time where I left him in the teacher lounge because he said he wanted to call his mom, so obviously I thought he wanted to be alone for that. He then texted my mom saying that I left him alone when he was really upset and that he wants me downstairs with him

[22-Nov-17 10:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
He won‚Äôt let me talk to other people by myself. Whenever I talk to anyone at break or lunch he has to drag me away from the conversation. When I had a really bad panic attack he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad your medicine is working‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to move schools because I can‚Äôt deal with this [me]‚Äù

[22-Nov-17 10:43 AM] josh#8811
What the fuck?

[22-Nov-17 10:43 AM] josh#8811
Oh my god

[22-Nov-17 10:44 AM] josh#8811
That is so horrible, especially with how he deals with your anxiety. That is not okay. Oh my God!

[22-Nov-17 10:45 AM] josh#8811
You deserve to talk to other people too

[22-Nov-17 10:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah so that‚Äôs why I want to break up with him

[22-Nov-17 10:45 AM] josh#8811
That is completely understandable

[22-Nov-17 10:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh another thing happened that crossed the line

[22-Nov-17 10:45 AM] josh#8811
Really? Please tell me

[22-Nov-17 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
So once we were home alone and he wanted to do stuff with me but I said no because I didnt want to. His response to that was he stopped talking to me (except for short replies) wouldn‚Äôt hug me, wouldn‚Äôt look at me, nothing. He didn‚Äôt stop until I gave in

[22-Nov-17 10:47 AM] Deleted User#0000

So I‚Äôm ending things with him

[22-Nov-17 10:49 AM] josh#8811
God, I bet. That was completely unacceptable of him, all of those things and especially this! He can NOT do that! I'm so glad you are breaking up with him

[22-Nov-17 10:49 AM] josh#8811
Good fucking riddance, jesus

[22-Nov-17 02:12 PM] josh#8811
Hmmm, I'm not sure; I'm going to my dad's house right after Thanksgiving and he doesn't really let me hang out with people, so I think the closest we could hang out is either sometime next week, or this afternoon (although you're tired, so I'm not sure how you feel about that)

[22-Nov-17 02:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean I could probably make this afternoon work somehow, unless you‚Äôd rather next week?

I might be able to do Monday after school, but we wouldn't have much time to hike since it gets pretty dark around 5, and my mom might not let me do that

[24-Nov-17 01:58 AM] josh#8811
Hey, I know it's really late and you're probably (hopefully) asleep, but I just feel like I need to talk to you...
You're an amazing person, and you're so strong, going through all of this stuff that is hitting you. I care about you so much, and I wish that I kept talking to you after expeditions last year, and didn't start talking to you just because I was worried about you; I feel very regretful about that. Whenever I talk to you, or hang out with you, you take all of my problems away, and you make me feel really great. This break has been pretty stressful, but you took a lot of that stress away, just by being there. You're so sweet, and caring, and fun, and I am so **so** lucky to have you in my life. I want you to know that I will always be here for you, and I want to support you as much as I can. 
When you told me about how Spencer treated you, I got so angry. He does not deserve you, not after how he's treated you. You shouldn't have been treated that way at all, and you shouldn't have to bear the stress of this break up either; this is a very difficult thing you will have to go through. I wish I could just hold you and make everything better, make all of this go away. 
And at the same time, part of me feels bad, and a little ashamed. Not because I feel very angry about Spencer, but because of the feelings I have when I'm with you. You bring out this warmness in me, whenever we're together; I feel like I shouldn't be feeling it, because it's taken over me so quickly. It's hard to describe, but it's okay. I know it's probably (hopefully) okay to feel that way about you.
I just felt like I needed to tell you all this, that you're awesome, and that I'm here, and I want to keep helping you through all of this. I hope you're having some great dreams, and I hope your kittens aren't eating your hair üò¨ . And I'm super sorry (and a little embarrassed) for the long message, I really couldn't help myself üòÖ

[24-Nov-17 09:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Josh, reading that makes me feel so flattered and happy. I am not going to lie, I have been feeling pretty similar to you. What I need you to understand though is that right now I am still with Spencer, and I am still trying to figure out my feelings. At the moment I don‚Äôt feel mentally stable enough for any relationship. Josh, I can barely hold friendships nowadays. And yes, maybe I enjoy your attention and how you always make me laugh. But I am so afraid that it is because I am unhappy with my relationship at the moment. So I am asking you to please give me time. I am not saying no to you, but I am still in a relationship. My mom said to give Spencer a 2-week notice, so that‚Äôs what I am doing. I had a serious talk with him yesterday about everything.

[24-Nov-17 09:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
And no the kittens aren‚Äôt eating my hair üòÇ

[24-Nov-17 10:53 AM] josh#8811
Hey, thank you very much for being honest with me; I will give you all the time you need, and I completely understand; being you is hard, and it's hard to figure out your emotions. I am happy that you are being open with me, and I am glad that you had a serious talk with him. I hope everything that happens in the next couple of weeks goes in the direction that you need it to go in order for your life to improve, and I will support you no matter what happens. I will be happy no matter what because I'll know that your life will be better üòÉ (sorry, I just woke up)

[24-Nov-17 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thank you for understanding and being such a good friend to me. If things between Spencer and I do end, I need you to understand that I will be working on myself, and I won‚Äôt be able to have a relationship for some time afterwards. I mean, I‚Äôve been with him for 2 years. Breaking up is going to be traumatic no matter who ends things.

[24-Nov-17 11:02 AM] josh#8811
It's no problem, that is perfectly okay. I understand that you'll have to work on yourself if that happens, and that's okay that you won't be able to have a relationship for some time. I am very happy to just be here and to talk to you, with nothing more.

All I‚Äôm going to say about your question is that I have a bunch of conflicting feelings and my mom is telling me that I‚Äôm not stable enough to make big decisions at the moment

[24-Nov-17 11:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
And I think she is right because he sent me a message last night that gave me a panic attack

He was talking about how much he cared about me

[24-Nov-17 11:23 AM] josh#8811
Man, I'm so sorry that you have to go through this. Do you think you went into a panic attack because you became afraid of breaking up after that? Or, did it give you a different reaction?

[24-Nov-17 11:23 AM] josh#8811
Goodness....

[24-Nov-17 11:24 AM] josh#8811
This sounds so stressful

[24-Nov-17 11:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Because my mom was there and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him, especially in front of her. I feel guilty almost, because I don‚Äôt feel the same but I don‚Äôt want him to be upset

[24-Nov-17 11:26 AM] josh#8811
That makes a lot of sense. It's really difficult, going through this, and figuring out what's going to happen. You're very empathetic

[25-Nov-17 10:09 AM] josh#8811
I had this really weird dream that you and I were at a Barenaked Ladies concert and you met Ed, the lead singer, and then it turned into us in a room standing up watching a small TV with like 20 other random people, but it was still the "concert" and then I looked behind me and Spencer was trying to get in the room to see the TV as well

[25-Nov-17 10:09 AM] josh#8811
It was super weird

It's just been corny stuff, like us going to a concert, or us hiking and talking, and holding hands and stuff; it's hard for me to remember the details now, but they were all nice dreams

Oh really? Is your bed not comfy

[25-Nov-17 04:38 PM] josh#8811
I definitely have a comfy bed, but I think yours is bigger and the fact that it's tucked away is cooler

Josh you are driving me crazy. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself anymore. I find myself constantly craving your affection, but I‚Äôm still committed to someone else. I don‚Äôt know where you came from or why, but you hit me hard. And it is driving me absolutely insane. I always want more and more from you, but I know that I can‚Äôt. I cannot deal with that. You are always on my mind. I can‚Äôt stand it. How could some boy come into my life so suddenly and take over it.

[25-Nov-17 07:17 PM] Deleted User#0000

Woah, hey. I had no idea you felt that way about me too! Gosh, this is a bit of a twister, isn't it. I gotta say, I feel that way about you too, pretty much exactly. Every time we hugged when we said our goodbyes, the thought of me kissing you has always crept into my brain, but every time I stop myself because you are with Spencer. I think about you so often, it's driving me mad as well. I don't want to interfere with your relationship with him, but part of me really does. I like you so much, but I don't want to make you do something like break it off with your boyfriend (unless you're absolutely sure). Man, jeez...

[25-Nov-17 08:22 PM] josh#8811
Hannah, I know you're watching a movie right now and probably can't reply, but you mean so much to me and I couldn't wait. I kept reading over your initial message, savoring it. It almost breaks my heart to know that we share this mutual feeling. My mind is practically reeling; I almost feel like life is fake, now that I know you feel for me as I feel for you. I think about you so often, all the time. Just being friends with you has taken away so much of my depression, and has filled a void in my chest that I thought could never be filled. All I want to do is hold you close, and just be with you. When we hold hands, or hug, you give me this amazing euphoria I've never experienced before. 
I care about you so much, and this makes me full of sorrow: you are under a lot of stress right now, and I can't imagine how much anxiety this is giving you. I do not want to stand in the way of your happiness at all, and if your happiness is continuing to date Spencer, then so be it.
But, at the same time (this is just my opinion here, I don't know too much about your relationship), I honestly hate Spencer because of what you have confided in me with. The way that I have heard him treating you, it disgusts me, and I believe that he will never change from who he is now into a better person in the week you are giving him. Both Ivonne and I don't think he is good for you. Even if we did not advance with our relationship *at all*, I would believe that you would be much better off if you were not with him any longer. It sounds like he only makes your life worse, and I don't think he cares about you as much as he should.

[25-Nov-17 08:22 PM] josh#8811
I could be completely wrong about your relationship, and saying what I said up there may be rude. But, I'm only saying it because I care for you and I want you to have what is best for you. I only want to keep you from your relationship with him because I feel as if you would have a better life without him. I really want to hear from you, and what you think is best for you.

[25-Nov-17 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I went to the bathroom to read your message. If Spencer doesn‚Äôt make it up to me this week he‚Äôs out. It would take a miracle for me to think twice about it though. Whether we are only friends or more, you are too special to me to let go

[25-Nov-17 08:26 PM] josh#8811

Good morning ‚õÖ

[26-Nov-17 09:05 AM] josh#8811
I had these weird dreams about you; most of them were just us messaging each other, but I had another one earlier that was of us just holding each other; that was the whole dream üòÖ

She was suspicious but she couldn‚Äôt confirm it until your last visit

Idk how my mom knows these things but she does

[26-Nov-17 09:54 AM] josh#8811
It's like she's a genius with social cues

[26-Nov-17 09:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
I am horrible at telling if people have a crush on me though, I want to be as good of a spy as her

[26-Nov-17 09:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm curious as to what social cues you are referring to

[26-Nov-17 09:57 AM] josh#8811
I'm guessing she was watching how we looked at each other, and our facial expressions, and how / when we laughed, maybe how close we sat next to each other, how much attention we paid to each other while talking, probably some other stuff

[26-Nov-17 09:58 AM] josh#8811
I started having suspicions when you changed seats and sat next to me on the couch at the friendsgiving

[26-Nov-17 09:59 AM] josh#8811
And I thought holding hands was either just you being really friendly or hopefully something more

[26-Nov-17 10:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah haha I‚Äôm very subtle about who I like üòÖ and at first holding hands was just comforting but I wanted to do it more and more. When we were walking home in the dark after going downtown I was screaming in my head because I was so nervous and excited

[26-Nov-17 10:01 AM] josh#8811
I love holding hands with you

[26-Nov-17 10:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Aw I love holding hands too

[26-Nov-17 10:02 AM] josh#8811
Heh, that one time when I suggested going on a walk but it was too dark, I only wanted to because then I could be closer to you

[26-Nov-17 10:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Smooth haha. I‚Äôm scared of the dark though

It‚Äôs really stressing me out though, I feel like she is making me feel worse

[26-Nov-17 04:10 PM] josh#8811
I think she is

[26-Nov-17 04:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I was actually starting to feel better

[26-Nov-17 04:10 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness

[26-Nov-17 04:10 PM] josh#8811
What would happen if you told her that?

[26-Nov-17 04:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just wish I could show her somehow I feel

[26-Nov-17 04:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would get kicked out

What?!

[26-Nov-17 04:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
There‚Äôs too much for me to type out, but it‚Äôs really annoying me

[26-Nov-17 04:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Her logic is hypocritical

[26-Nov-17 04:11 PM] josh#8811
Oh god

[26-Nov-17 04:11 PM] josh#8811
I hate that

[26-Nov-17 04:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs crazy because my mom is my best friend, but when it comes to relationships she is horrible

[26-Nov-17 04:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
And my dad is scared of her so he takes her side all the time

[26-Nov-17 04:12 PM] josh#8811
Ugh

[26-Nov-17 04:12 PM] josh#8811
That sounds so painful

[26-Nov-17 04:12 PM] josh#8811

I'm so sorry

[26-Nov-17 04:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Robert said that she wants me to be with Spencer so much because his family is wealthy, which is so stupid because my happiness matters more

[26-Nov-17 04:14 PM] josh#8811
What the hell? That does not make any sense

[26-Nov-17 04:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Robert also said that Spencer isn‚Äôt ready for committed relationships because of his upbringing, so he said if I‚Äôm not happy to leave him

[26-Nov-17 04:15 PM] josh#8811
That makes sense

[26-Nov-17 04:15 PM] josh#8811
And your feelings matter much more than money

[26-Nov-17 04:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Totally. I‚Äôd rather be with someone poor but be happy than be with someone rich and unhappy

[26-Nov-17 04:15 PM] josh#8811

[26-Nov-17 04:16 PM] josh#8811

[26-Nov-17 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôll have to talk to Robert again, I need to find a way to deal with this. I wish you were too. I really wish she could just give me a chance. And this whole thing might be the biggest mistake ever, but I‚Äôm willing to give it a chance because I care about my happiness and I care about you

[26-Nov-17 04:18 PM] josh#8811
Aww, hey I care about you too, and I care about your happiness as well. You should definitely talk to Robert some more

[26-Nov-17 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can‚Äôt wait until we get back into school so I don‚Äôt have to be with her all the time. It seems like all we do is argue all the time nowadays, and I hate it

[26-Nov-17 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I partially blame her for my feelings for you too

[26-Nov-17 04:19 PM] josh#8811
You do?

[26-Nov-17 04:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, because she kept calling you cute and that if I wanted to explore my options I could

I want to fuck you so bad Hannah, I am going mad just thinking about your wet underwear

[01-Dec-17 12:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah? You like the thought of my underwear getting wet from the thought of you? Or the fact that I‚Äôve been touching myself this entire time at the thought of us having sex. I have gotten so wet, I can feel the dampness from the outside of my pajama bottoms.

[01-Dec-17 12:05 PM] josh#8811
Mmm, both. Especially that you're getting so wet. You're making me get a hard on in class

[01-Dec-17 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
You made me so wet, twice today. I want you to touch me so badly, I want you to eat me out, feel my naked body, and I want you to fuck me as hard as you can

[01-Dec-17 12:07 PM] josh#8811
You are so fucking hot, I want to strip you down and fuck you until you scream. I want to taste you and feel your insides pulse as you cum again and again

Ivonne messaged me saying she thinks you hate her cause she accidentally said to Spencer that your mom said we were horrible; she said she meant to say that she felt horrible but she misspoke and didn't realize it, and she's really worried that you hate her now

Well, you see, I've never ever seen another person in the woods of twin pines park; I've fantasized about us going there and after the sun sets, we kiss and eventually have sex in the dark

[01-Dec-17 02:47 PM] josh#8811
It's so risky cause it's outside, but that makes it a little more exciting doesn't it?

Well I wasn‚Äôt trying to be obvious because rylee was there but I faced away from you so my butt was towards you. There was also just the excitement of being in my bed with a boy

That's really hot

[01-Dec-17 03:12 PM] josh#8811
You know, I checked you out a lot when you went up the stairs to get your kittens that time, when they were playing

[01-Dec-17 03:13 PM] josh#8811
And I got a nice view when we played hide and seek, before I said moist in your ear

[01-Dec-17 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000

We have to wait a month to officially date, Robert says

[02-Dec-17 04:48 PM] josh#8811
That's okay, I'm all for waiting if it's what he / you thinks is good for you

[02-Dec-17 04:48 PM] josh#8811
Plus, it doesn't mean we can't just be cool friends in the mean time ‚ò∫

He is just saying a month for our reputation + my mom

Yeah, she doesn‚Äôt hate you though

[02-Dec-17 04:51 PM] Deleted User#0000

[02-Dec-17 05:15 PM] josh#8811
When you called me daddy I started to get pretty close, and then when you sent that pic and said you wanted me to cum all over you and you wanted me inside you I couldn't handle it

[02-Dec-17 05:15 PM] josh#8811

[02-Dec-17 08:38 PM] josh#8811
Do you know what would happen if we were home alone, sitting where you're sitting?

[02-Dec-17 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
What would happen?

[02-Dec-17 08:38 PM] josh#8811

Josh I love you so much. You are the reason I wake us in the morning and stay up at night. You are the sun and I am the planets revolving around you. My heart beats for you. All of the love songs on the radio are about you. I could be broke, homeless, have no education, and be unsure about my future, but if I knew I had you I would know that I would be alright. You have completely taken control of my heart. I cannot stop thinking about you. I care about you endlessly, and the way I feel about you is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever felt. My heart aches because I cannot hold you in my arms and tell you how much you mean to me right now. You are so special, and you should know that because I never send long, sappy, late-night messages to people. You have not only taken control of my dreams, I go throughout my day thinking about you. It drives me crazy. You have made my day today so, so awesome. I cannot stop thinking about everything. I would do anything to lay with you right now. I would risk everything-and I have- to be with you. I care about and love you so much

To be honest, I'm a little uncomfortable kissing you / saying romantic stuff on front of Ivonne

[04-Dec-17 09:34 PM] josh#8811
But I think that's going away

[04-Dec-17 09:34 PM] josh#8811
I've just never done any of this before

How did you sleep?

I think I slept pretty well, except for this one bad dream

Oh no! Do you want to tell me about it?

[05-Dec-17 06:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay

[05-Dec-17 06:53 AM] josh#8811
So, I was in plt, and I look at my hands all of a sudden, and I know they're not mine. They look the same, but completely different at the same time. And then I looked at my jeans and even though they looked the same, to me they looked completely different, like I was in a different body. I got so freaked out in the dream that I yelled "what the fuck" really loudly, and I forced myself to stop looking at myself. It was really weird because I remember my thumb looked different in the dream, so I looked at it as soon as I woke up to see if it always looked like in the dream, and it didn't.

[05-Dec-17 06:54 AM] josh#8811
Now that I read it it doesn't sound scary, but it freaked me out when I dreamt it

[05-Dec-17 06:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
It must‚Äôve been really freaky to experience that. It‚Äôs not like an ax murderer dream, but not being in your own body would be a weird feeling

[05-Dec-17 06:55 AM] josh#8811
It was, yeah

[05-Dec-17 06:55 AM] josh#8811
But yeah, other than that I slept well

During expeditions I can actually take you off campus at lunch and we can grab food and come back, if you're interested in that; I mean, it's not much, but if we still can't meet after school by then then that's a small option

Hannah, you mean so much to me. This past week has been amazing, spending time with you. I'm so happy to hear that you were feeling well during lunch, and at the end of the day. I love spending time with you, and I love seeing you spend time with the people you want to spend time with. Knowing that you feel good is extremely important to me; I don't feel good if you don't. 
I feel like our relationship has definitely changed from the week before Thanksgiving break, no doubt about that. It's changed in a good way for sure, and I'm very happy that it's changed. I still want to be your caretaker when you need me to be, like before Thanksgiving break; if you're not feeling well and you need me, please tell me right away and I will help all I can. If you need space, I completely understand. If you want a hug, I'll give you one; any time, any place.

[06-Dec-17 08:08 PM] josh#8811
I know that I've been paranoid ever since what happened on Monday, with everything that's going on. 
I want to be honest with you, and tell you why I've been so paranoid; I feel like it's important for me to do that. I feel paranoid because, we're at sort of a crossroads here. You just broke up with Spencer, but not everyone knows that happened, or what we have between us. I don't know what you want to happen next; I understand that you want to give me affection out in the open for the most part, but I don't know whether you want other people to know that we're more than just friends at this point. I really like being direct with you, and knowing what you want or need. I couldn't kiss you this afternoon partly because I don't know who you want to know about our relationship right now; it's silly, because I know you wanted to kiss me, but I still had something pull me back. My big fear is that Spencer finds out that we have this relationship through other people  I'm actually not as afraid of Spencer's reaction as much as I'm afraid of the idea of it happening before you want it to happen.
To say it in a shorter way, I want to know how and when you want to make our relationship more public before the opportunity for us to show affection in public comes up again. This isn't because I want it to be private; I want it to be as public as you want it to be, but I don't know how public that is. I love you, and I care about you very much. It means so much to me to know how you feel and what you want to do that will make you feel comfortable.

[06-Dec-17 08:20 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry if this was too long, I felt like I had to say it. It's okay if you can't reply

Awww Josh ‚ò∫Ô∏è you are too sweet to me. I think we can really kick things into gear after winter break, do you agree?

[06-Dec-17 09:13 PM] josh#8811
I agree, whatever you think is good üòä

[06-Dec-17 09:14 PM] josh#8811
So, we keep it more private for now, and then we start to open things up more after winter break?

[06-Dec-17 09:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
It kills me knowing that my mom doesn‚Äôt approve of you, we fight every day about it. You should be grateful, because I‚Äôve risked literally everything to keep our relationship afloat. I really care about you and love you, and you are someone I know I cannot live without. You are so important to me, and you have become so significant lately. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, as long as I am with you I‚Äôm happy. And yes open up more after break

[06-Dec-17 09:18 PM] josh#8811
I am endlessly grateful for you Hannah, I cannot live without you and I can't stand the situation your mother is putting you in because of me. I love you so much

I wish we could go on a walk together like we did before the friendsgiving meet up. I loved holding your hand, and I loved talking to you with nobody else around. I want to get to know you more really badly. I want to know everything about you, and have you know everything about me. I can't wait to go on a date with you, so that we can connect more. You're the nicest person I know, and I can't wait to build our relationship even more ‚ù§

[06-Dec-17 10:26 PM] josh#8811
I want to hold you and watch the sun set together

[06-Dec-17 10:27 PM] josh#8811
I want to stay in with you on a rainy day and watch movies and eat comfort food and cuddle

Oops I'm still awake

[06-Dec-17 10:56 PM] josh#8811
This is a little silly, but after we met up for the second time I stopped watching dirty videos because I couldn't get you out of my mind and they didn't do anything for me (they still don't now) after I grew closer to you

[06-Dec-17 11:08 PM] josh#8811
I was also extremely depressed at the time, and I did a lot of increasingly horrible things to myself right before we met up on Friday. I was self harming since around the middle of sophomore year, and I was getting worse since I ran into so much bad luck (my rat died, I had a huge bike crash, Nico told Mr Z about my depression and I had to convince him not to tell my mom). I stopped working on my projects and I was pretty much on the verge of suicide because everything was so stressful. But, all of that faded away after I hung out with you a few times during thanksgiving break. I stopped self harming because I had something to look forward to, and I guess some part of me knew that we would get much closer; I didn't have any other reason to stop self harming. You pulled me out of my depression just by being there. You practically saved my life! I am extremely grateful for that, and I don't know how to repay you other than by being here for you and helping you out of your anxiety.

[06-Dec-17 11:10 PM] josh#8811
That might be a lot to take in, but it's part of who I am, or who I was. I was seriously depressed, and you got me out of it with the wave of a hand

[06-Dec-17 11:12 PM] josh#8811
When you told me that morning that you were going to break up with Spencer, I thought i was in a dream. I almost burst out laughing nervously after I processed what was happening. I thought I didn't have a chance with you at all, and I didn't realize what was happening until that morning

[06-Dec-17 11:15 PM] josh#8811
I still can't believe that we have this mutual feeling for each other. It's too good to be true. For most of my life, I've never had anything romantic cross over whatsoever. It's amazing what being with you does to me. You make my day a million times better, and I love you

[06-Dec-17 11:17 PM] josh#8811
Okay, I actually have to sleep now, but it was fun sending you these messages. I love you so much and I can't wait to see you tomorrow. Message me when you can talk, and I'll be there. Goodnight sweetheart ‚ù§

Josh I want to do all of those things you listed above. I want to watch movies with you, I want to bake cookies and cook dinner with you. I want to go on walks after dark because we can, I want to go on dates and dress all fancy for you. I am so happy you are in my life, and I am really happy that I can be here for you. I really want to cuddle with you and giggle until we fall asleep. You make me so happy, I can‚Äôt even put my feelings into words. No words in the dictionary can describe how you make me feel. I can‚Äôt wait to see you today. I also really wish that we were able to hang out outside of school, because that was a ton of fun. I really care about you and I only wish you happiness and love in your life. It pains me to know all that you‚Äôve been through. I wish I could take all the bad things away and just hold you. I wish my kisses healed your wounds. I would do anything, literally anything to make it all better. You make me so happy and I want you to always feel the same way

We were at the mall with my mom and sister but they went to a different part than we did, and we got a little excited so we found a bathroom and I was touching your chest under your shirt...

[09-Dec-17 09:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh that‚Äôs funny, I had a dream where we were at the movies and we went into the bathroom together. But continue üòä

But yeah, we went to find a better place because the bathroom wasn't good enough for some reason and the dream ended there. But it was really good

What happened in your dream? üòâ

[09-Dec-17 09:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well I can‚Äôt remember much of it, but it basically went like this: we were at the movie theater with our friends, and I decided to ‚Äúgo to the bathroom,‚Äù and you followed. We went into the private bathroom, and you immediately started to take off my shirt

[09-Dec-17 09:42 AM] josh#8811
Ooooh, I can imagine doing that

[09-Dec-17 09:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
After taking off my shirt, you left hickies all over my chest

And it gets blurry after that, I can‚Äôt really remember what happened

It‚Äôs called ‚Äúdoki doki literature club‚Äù what makes it interesting is that you are able to manipulate how the game works. Files also delete themselves as you play

Yay! It‚Äôs okay

She's not letting me have my phone until like next week, cause I'm so behind but I have a tablet

We were at school, but it was super different looking cause it felt like we were in an underground room with a lot of kids an arcade games, but it was still school for some reason. We were walking around together and then we started kissing. We were looking for a quieter place and started making out really passionately in an empty hallway. The dream ended after that but it was very enjoyable

That does sound nice ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[10-Dec-17 07:45 PM] josh#8811
This weekend has been making me feel very stressed. My mother has been on my back the second I got home

[10-Dec-17 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
There‚Äôs no need to apologize

[10-Dec-17 07:46 PM] josh#8811
That's true, but she just said to me that I'm going to stay home for some of it, which doesn't make sense because I'm never productive at home and I can't pass content

[10-Dec-17 07:47 PM] josh#8811
It's really stressing me out

[10-Dec-17 07:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
That sucks, she should be encouraging you to go to school. At least we can treasure the times you are at school

[10-Dec-17 07:48 PM] josh#8811
Yeah

[10-Dec-17 07:48 PM] josh#8811

Why does she want you to sleep upstairs?

Idk, she‚Äôs been making me sleep with her the past few weeks

It also sounds like it's just going to be harder for her to let you go

You will? I hope she won't get mad

Okay. It‚Äôs just really annoying, I like having space

I understand that, I wouldn't like it if I had to sleep with my mom either

[10-Dec-17 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have to be squished between both parents

[10-Dec-17 08:20 PM] josh#8811

That sounds claustrophobic

It is, I get really uncomfortable and I always wake up during the night

And my mom is like ‚Äústop moving‚Äù every time I try to get more space

[10-Dec-17 08:21 PM] josh#8811
That's rude of her

Why is that?

[10-Dec-17 08:49 PM] josh#8811
She stresses me out so much because when she talks about my schoolwork, like she calls me a fuckup because I'm having a hard time, and she's really really argumentative

[10-Dec-17 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh no she shouldn‚Äôt call you that because you are struggling

[10-Dec-17 08:50 PM] josh#8811
We just spent 20 minutes arguing because I said I was slightly interested in taking a semester of Japanese even though I told her that I wouldn't want to pursue it

[10-Dec-17 08:50 PM] josh#8811
I don't think she should either

I did a bunch of research and read part of the book online

I thought it would be a good intro to psychology

It‚Äôs probably expensive too, you didn‚Äôt have to get me this

[11-Dec-17 11:07 AM] josh#8811
I had to buy it used since it's a college textbook, and they're like a bajillion dollars new

It wasnt too expensive, it's okay

It went well. It was nice to have closure and see where he is at

[11-Dec-17 08:52 PM] josh#8811
I'm very glad you have closure

[11-Dec-17 08:52 PM] josh#8811

I can‚Äôt go into detail but it‚Äôs been rough for him

[11-Dec-17 08:53 PM] josh#8811
Gosh, I'm sorry

[11-Dec-17 08:53 PM] josh#8811
He didn't sound good when we talked today

[11-Dec-17 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs tough for him because he lost me and now he is losing friends

[11-Dec-17 08:54 PM] josh#8811
I think I need to be there for him and help him out a little bit, he told me he's out of the loop with everyone and it sounds like he's really struggling

[11-Dec-17 08:55 PM] josh#8811
I've been doing my best to help him feel better

[11-Dec-17 08:55 PM] josh#8811
Which is why I'm starting to be more afraid of being with you on front of him, but honestly I'm sure it shouldn't be bad

[11-Dec-17 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs a good thing for you to do. Just give it time

[11-Dec-17 08:56 PM] josh#8811
I asked him to talk to his therapist about it too, because it really felt like he was talking to me like how he might talk to his

[11-Dec-17 08:57 PM] josh#8811
In the meantime I'm there to listen to him and help him understand himself

[11-Dec-17 08:57 PM] josh#8811
Are you going to be able to sleep in your own bed tonight?

[11-Dec-17 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000

Something weird happened today

[11-Dec-17 09:11 PM] josh#8811
What happened?

[11-Dec-17 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well actually two things

[11-Dec-17 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
The first thing is that I was staring at my computer, doing a checkpoint when all of the sudden the screen looked askew. Then it looked like it was turning sideways

[11-Dec-17 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmmm

[11-Dec-17 09:12 PM] josh#8811

[11-Dec-17 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000

[11-Dec-17 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
And second thing

[11-Dec-17 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I feel like I need to cry and let my emotions out but my body isn‚Äôt allowing me to

[11-Dec-17 09:13 PM] josh#8811
Oh no, God I hate that feeling

[11-Dec-17 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like I felt like crying when I was brushing my teeth but it stopped as soon as it started

[11-Dec-17 09:13 PM] josh#8811
You did?

[11-Dec-17 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000

[11-Dec-17 09:13 PM] josh#8811

[11-Dec-17 09:13 PM] josh#8811
I get that sometimes

[11-Dec-17 09:14 PM] josh#8811
Why did you feel like crying?

[11-Dec-17 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000

I don't know how you're getting through this

[11-Dec-17 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
My mind is blocking out everything and acting like everything is fine

[11-Dec-17 09:16 PM] josh#8811
I got that feeling when my mom gave me this gaba supplement when i was depressed

Lmaoooo

[11-Dec-17 09:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I guess my brain chemistry is messed up and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do

[11-Dec-17 09:17 PM] josh#8811
I can relate to your feeling, doesn't it feel like your body feels almost a lack of emotion, like neutrality, but you're almost screaming at it to feel bad?

[11-Dec-17 09:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes! I didn‚Äôt care when my mom said she was going to take away going to college. I didn‚Äôt cry when I broke up with Spencer, nothing

[11-Dec-17 09:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn‚Äôt cry when my mom was screaming and hitting the wall

[11-Dec-17 09:18 PM] josh#8811
That's how I used to feel before I met with you more

[11-Dec-17 09:18 PM] josh#8811
That's depression

[11-Dec-17 09:19 PM] josh#8811
Or, part of it

[11-Dec-17 09:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I know I have depression. I was diagnosed with it. It‚Äôs a result of me going off the lexapro

[11-Dec-17 09:19 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, I didn't know

[11-Dec-17 09:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, she said Major Depressive Disorder I think? That‚Äôs why I have the 504

Agh

[11-Dec-17 09:20 PM] josh#8811
I don't want you to have it

[11-Dec-17 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt want to have it either. But I‚Äôm trying my best to get over it

[11-Dec-17 09:23 PM] josh#8811
I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but because I'm pretty experienced with depression I have to ask you because I don't want you going the same path as I did. Are you having any thoughts of self harm or suicide? I won't be surprised or freak out if you do, because you've gone through all of this. I know the feeling

[11-Dec-17 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
No. There have been times that I felt like not eating so I could feel control over my mom or something but I only did that at the way beginning

[11-Dec-17 09:25 PM] josh#8811
Okay, I'm very glad

[11-Dec-17 09:25 PM] josh#8811
Please tell me if you ever do

[11-Dec-17 09:25 PM] josh#8811
I can help you

I lost like 4 pounds though

[11-Dec-17 09:26 PM] josh#8811
Oh no!

[11-Dec-17 09:26 PM] josh#8811
When was that?

[11-Dec-17 09:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the way beginning. There was one day where the only thing I ate was a lozenge

[11-Dec-17 09:27 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness

[11-Dec-17 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
But I‚Äôm okay now. I eat a ton of trail mix and bagels at school

[11-Dec-17 09:28 PM] josh#8811
I'm very glad you are okay now

[11-Dec-17 09:28 PM] josh#8811
I have problems with eating sometimes as well

[11-Dec-17 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs coupled with depression though because it changes your appetite

[11-Dec-17 09:28 PM] josh#8811
I lost around 10 pounds in 3 weeks at one point when my depression got worse

[11-Dec-17 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh no that‚Äôs really bad

[11-Dec-17 09:29 PM] josh#8811
It's okay, I've gained it back

[11-Dec-17 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay

[11-Dec-17 09:29 PM] josh#8811
But I know that feeling where you have to make yourself eat

[11-Dec-17 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[11-Dec-17 09:30 PM] josh#8811
It's horrible cause you just don't really feel like eating even though part of you has hunger

[11-Dec-17 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn‚Äôt feel hungry at all. The thought of eating made me want to throw up

[11-Dec-17 09:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it‚Äôs better now

[11-Dec-17 09:32 PM] josh#8811
I don't think I had it bad enough to make me want to throw up, but I remember that when I didn't feel like eating being around food, especially meat, made me really nauseous. I just knew some part of me was hungry because I had that feeling when I was hungry

I am so glad to hear you say that

[11-Dec-17 09:46 PM] josh#8811
I'm really insecure about my relationship with you sometimes, and it helps so much hearing that I help you and make you happy. I love being there for you and making you feel good, and my worst fear is that you don't enjoy your time with me (which I know isn't true). I love you so much and I can't wait to hug you again and help you feel better

[11-Dec-17 09:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why do you feel insecure about our relationship?

[11-Dec-17 09:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can assure you that I really care about you

[11-Dec-17 09:50 PM] josh#8811
Because, I've never had this with anyone before, and I think I have low self esteem. You say these amazing things to me, and we have this awesome intimacy. I'm afraid that it's fading every single time we don't talk for a while, because you are the best thing in my life right now and I don't know what I would do if you went away. I'm amazed, completely amazed that we have this mutual feeling for each other. I'm used to liking girls and not having them like me back, and having to watch every single thing I say to make sure it is good. It's really unfamiliar having someone I love love me back, and part of me assumes that you're going to stop loving me any second

[11-Dec-17 09:52 PM] josh#8811
It's not your fault at all that I feel this way, because I know that you care for me, but the negative part of me always assumes it no matter what I do to fight it

[11-Dec-17 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I can tell you one thing: you don‚Äôt know how much I care about you. You dominate my thoughts and dreams. If there is one thing you should know about me, its when I love someone, I love them with all my heart. And when that voice in your head doubts that, tell it to shut up. And if that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll tell it to shut up. Because I love you josh, you are an awesome person and I will happily give you hugs and kisses for as long as you want me to

[11-Dec-17 09:55 PM] josh#8811
I love you too, I love you so much

Hey, I'm glad that I helped you feel better today. I enjoyed having my arm around you, and I love you. Does it help when I have my arm around you when you're initially feeling bad, or only when you're starting to feel better? I hope your stomachache goes away soon, and I'm thinking of you.

[12-Dec-17 04:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I love you too. It helps when I‚Äôm starting to feel better. I can‚Äôt reply after this but I really appreciate it

Thank you for telling me what helps, I appreciate it because I know how to make you feel better best I can. It's okay that you can't reply, I will talk to you later

Okay I‚Äôm here

[12-Dec-17 04:39 PM] josh#8811
I don't want you to be tired tomorrow, I feel pretty guilty making you stay up last night. How about whenever you want to have some "fun" you tell me, and we can go from there? I really don't want to keep you awake just so that I can get off; it's not enjoyable if I know you're not enjoying it. I care about you and I want you to get enough sleep

[12-Dec-17 04:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thank you for understanding. I just don‚Äôt do well when I stay up late. I will let you know if I am ‚Äúin the mood‚Äù though

The way you smile when you see me, your laugh, how your cheeks flush when you want to kiss me. How once you get one kiss from me you can‚Äôt get enough, like today when I said I had to go to class but you didn‚Äôt want to let go. The way your frame looks against your T-shirt‚Äôs.

Hey, I just wanted to thank you again for the fun we had. I don't want to keep you up later than you feel like tomorrow night, and I don't want to make it feel like you absolutely have to send pictures. If you need to sleep, that's a higher priority than this, and if you don't feel comfortable sending something tomorrow, then please tell me and I will completely understand. I value your health and your pleasure more than mine, and I love you. Thank you for literally one of the best orgasms I've had ever, by the way. I literally shot cum several feet in all directions, it was ecstasy. I hope I can bring you to orgasm tomorrow night, as I feel guilty being the only one getting to finish. Thank you again for an amazing night. I hope you are having sweet dreams, and I love you so much darling ‚ù§

[16-Dec-17 09:54 PM] josh#8811
When my mom came home, she was really angry at me and kept telling me off for really small things (for example I brought a shoebox upstairs with the groceries but she didn't want me too, and she berated me for several minutes about it). She was extremely uptight and I really couldn't take it anymore. She's been gone for an hour now, at some sort of get together, but I'm still calming down

[16-Dec-17 09:55 PM] josh#8811
I'd say it wasn't my best day but I've had worse, and I get to talk to you so it's getting better

It's ripping me up thinking about you

[18-Dec-17 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think our best bet is you working in the hallway and I go to the bathroom

[18-Dec-17 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or maybe the staircase, that‚Äôs probably better

[18-Dec-17 09:26 PM] josh#8811
I think me sitting on the stairs working is the best

[18-Dec-17 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Haha what expression?

[18-Dec-17 09:34 PM] josh#8811
Sometimes when you look at me you give a half smirk half smile that just says "heyy" and I love it because you're saying to me "hey, I know we have to pretend like nothings going on between us but this look shows that things are, and it's not something you're making up in your head"

[18-Dec-17 09:35 PM] josh#8811
At least, that's how I take it

[18-Dec-17 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000

How is your relationship with Spencer going? As in relationship, I just mean sort of how you guys are doing

[18-Dec-17 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can tell he really wants to be in a relationship with me, but obviously I don‚Äôt feel the same way

[18-Dec-17 10:04 PM] josh#8811
I can tell too, the way he sits close to you and tries to relate with everything

[18-Dec-17 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, in psychology he sat so close to me that his leg was practically resting on top of mine

[18-Dec-17 10:05 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness, I don't know what to think about that

[18-Dec-17 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I scooted over a bit

[18-Dec-17 10:05 PM] josh#8811
I think he got the wrong idea when you kissed him

[18-Dec-17 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I feel like I‚Äôm trapped. My mom really wants me to stay in contact with him, but he instantly gets overbearing as soon as I let him in

[18-Dec-17 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I guess I‚Äôll just not do anything that could possibly lure him in

[18-Dec-17 10:06 PM] josh#8811
I feel like you're trapped too. I know she wants you guys to be back together I think, because she gave him those snacks today at lunch

[18-Dec-17 10:08 PM] josh#8811
I know we keep saying it's all going to blow over and we can come out eventually but I feel like it's going to take a while with everything that's going on. And I think I can wait for it, but it's just stressful. Probably more stressful for you than for me because you're more trapped. Gosh, I don't know

[18-Dec-17 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
I feel like after break it‚Äôll get better. I‚Äôm taking a new medicine, my mom will restore her faith in me, all that good stuff. And just think, the wait will make it even better in the end

[18-Dec-17 10:10 PM] josh#8811
I think I need to be more optimistic. The wait does make it better. I think things will get better, yeah. Thank you for the kind words

[18-Dec-17 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Of course, and being optimistic is a good thing. Time is going to go by really fast here on out, so I promise you won‚Äôt have to wait forever

Yeah üòä

[18-Dec-17 10:15 PM] josh#8811
Aww! I don't even know how that's possible haha, but I am extremely flattered. You know, when i first met you i thought you were way above me, way out of my league because of how you're really attractive

[18-Dec-17 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am being 100% honest and serious when I say that. And it is hard for me to believe that you thought that, but I am very happy that you find me really attractive

I feel the same lol, it's really hard for me to believe stuff like that

Your eyes are so easy to stare into, and I love touching your hair too. You have a cute nose and I love wrapping my arms around your waist. You dress really cute every day, and I love everything you wear

I would love that

[18-Dec-17 10:51 PM] josh#8811
This is a really weird thought but i wonder what it would feel like if we cuddled naked, because we'd be so close to each other and it would be so intimate

[18-Dec-17 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Probably cold and would most likely end up having sex

So, we're cuddling in bed and you're in that gown. And, I start to kiss your neck and you let out these cute moans. I start to gently caress your breasts and I slide a hand down your waist as I kiss your neck. I pull up the gown and reach my hand in your underwear and I start to gently rub you as you moan even more. Goodness, I'm getting a hard on now that I'm typing it out

[19-Dec-17 12:22 AM] josh#8811
Hey, I know you're asleep right now but I wanted to say I'm sorry. It was wrong for me to start talking dirty like that, I knew you were getting tired. I know I keep saying i want only what's best for you and that I care about you so much, but I can't control myself sometimes. Sometimes I put myself before you when I shouldn't, and I acknowledge it and I know it's bad. I'm going to work on it as much as I can. I get really impulsive, and I need to train myself to take a step back  and ask before I keep going. 
I understand you said you were dealing with something when we were texting. You don't have to apologise for it, it's perfectly okay that you couldn't text me. I hope that everything is better and you're sleeping well. I'm very sorry, once again. I know that apologies don't do too much. I really hope that I will stop screwing up and having to apologize to you after. I hope I can be a better person. 
You are amazing, and you are awesome. You are kind and sweet and caring, and you are smart and strong. I love you, and I hope you sleep well.

[19-Dec-17 06:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hey, I really appreciate your apology but please don‚Äôt worry about it too much. I‚Äôm not going to hold it against you. Just the fact that you recognized it and texted me shows how good of a person you are. I love you so much and I hope you had a good rest of your evening

[19-Dec-17 10:52 PM] josh#8811
Me too, it would take so much stress away. When I see you with our friends I feel horrible, because my brain convinces me that we don't have anything between us and I'm making it up (until you give me looks like you do), and when we can actually be intimate and talk to each other and hug and kiss I feel a bazillion times better

Well just know that I‚Äôm not faking my feelings, I absolutely adore you. And I just really want to be able to hold your hand and everything without worrying about anything. I want to go on dates and plan fun things to do

[19-Dec-17 10:55 PM] josh#8811
Goodness me too, and I know for sure that what we have is real. Especially when we meet up and talk. I just have a problem with my internal thoughts sometimes, and I'm working on it but it hits me like that every so often. When I'm with you I never doubt our love. I can't wait to date you out in the open

It feels like a dream or something to me. I never ever thought this would happen to me, ever. I hope we can date and be a couple too, I guess we just have to wait it out

Yeah, I promise it will work out and be okay. Just know that I think that you are so attractive, seeing you smile brings me joy, your kisses make me forget all my problems, and your hugs make me feel safe and secure üòò

[19-Dec-17 11:02 PM] josh#8811
You are the most attractive person I know, and seeing you smile at me back makes me feel so much better. I love kissing and hugging you, you bring me pure ecstasy. I love making you feel safe too üòö

Hmmm, I'm really not sure. I don't want to keep you up late since you have that interview tomorrow. I'm a hormonal teen so I'm feeling like fooling around, but I really don't want to keep you up since you want to go to bed.

Me neither. I feel like we are spending all this money for therapy for nothing

[20-Dec-17 01:25 PM] josh#8811
I feel like you're sometimes using therapy to talk about your mother and fix your relationship with her but it's so hard to make that happen, especially the way she acts

[20-Dec-17 01:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
She‚Äôs admitted to being explosive too, but she isn‚Äôt doing anything to control it

[20-Dec-17 01:26 PM] josh#8811
Admitting is the first step, but if she's not trying to change I don't feel like she will

[20-Dec-17 01:27 PM] josh#8811
Sometimes the problem with people is that they don't think the problem is their fault, and that may be what's going on with your mom. She might not realize her explosions/actions hurt you

[20-Dec-17 01:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôve told her multiple times:‚ÄùI feel this way when you do that‚Äù but it continues

[20-Dec-17 01:28 PM] josh#8811
That sounds like it ties back to how you said she thinks she knows how you feel

[20-Dec-17 01:29 PM] josh#8811
I don't know what other advice to offer but to tell her how you feel when she does it, in the same moment if her doing it. I don't even know if that will work too. I'm so sorry

[20-Dec-17 01:29 PM] josh#8811
I wish I could make this go away

[20-Dec-17 01:30 PM] josh#8811

Yeah, it‚Äôs quiet. A bit awkward because Logan is in here but it‚Äôs better than sitting in the hallway

[20-Dec-17 01:41 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad it's helping

[20-Dec-17 01:41 PM] josh#8811
I wish I knew how to help you even more right now

Do you know something that I find really stupid

[20-Dec-17 01:42 PM] josh#8811
What's really stupid?

[20-Dec-17 01:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
When you came over my mom concluded that you just wanted to get in my pants and nothing else, because she could tell by our body language or whatever. But the first time Spencer came over to our house, he planted his face on my chest on purpose

[20-Dec-17 01:44 PM] josh#8811
What the hell? I was actually trying my best not to be a creep and I had no thought of doing that with you because you were with Spencer. Sure, I wanted to kiss you but I held that back. God, what's her problem?

[20-Dec-17 01:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
She makes snap judgements without actually getting to know a person

[20-Dec-17 01:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
And there is nothing I could do or say to change her mind

[20-Dec-17 01:46 PM] josh#8811
Well, I guess the next time I meet with her (if that ever happens) I'll force myself to not be interested in you body-language wise

[20-Dec-17 01:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs kind of hard not to though

[20-Dec-17 01:47 PM] josh#8811
It is, it's very hard

[20-Dec-17 01:47 PM] josh#8811
But if she'll only think of me through that then it'll have to change so that she tolerates me

[20-Dec-17 01:48 PM] josh#8811
You know one thing I'm really thankful for?

[20-Dec-17 01:48 PM] josh#8811
That when she walked into the private room when I was with you I didn't have my arm around you, because if I did then shit would have gone down I think

[20-Dec-17 01:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well it was pretty bad, but that would have made it even worse

[20-Dec-17 01:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
And you don‚Äôt have to change yourself for my mom

[20-Dec-17 01:49 PM] josh#8811
I hope I won't

[20-Dec-17 01:50 PM] josh#8811
But it's okay if I have to

[20-Dec-17 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
My mom can‚Äôt dictate who I go out with. All that should matter is that I am happy

[20-Dec-17 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which I am when I‚Äôm with you

[20-Dec-17 01:50 PM] josh#8811
Thank you, I'm happy when I'm with you too

[20-Dec-17 01:51 PM] josh#8811
I guess we'll just have to see what happens next year. I don't know how she'll react if you tell her we're dating

[20-Dec-17 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm sure she wouldn‚Äôt like it

[20-Dec-17 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
But she can‚Äôt control me, especially once I turn 18

[20-Dec-17 01:52 PM] josh#8811
I agree

What's the game about? I don't think I've heard of it

It‚Äôs basically you are playing as a guy in a cauldron with a hammer, and you need to drag him through this whole obstacle course

I should check that out tomorrow when I have my phone üôÇ

[20-Dec-17 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
The app is a little expensive, I got a gift card today to pay for it. But it‚Äôs even more on steam

[20-Dec-17 10:26 PM] josh#8811
I think on android phones there's a bootleg way to install paid apps for free since you can find the file online and download / install it that way

[20-Dec-17 10:26 PM] josh#8811
So I can just do that haha

Oh okay, do that then lol

Oh wow that is very expensive

I thought it was like 99¬¢

[20-Dec-17 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000

It sounds very cool though, from what I've heard so far

Yeah, you should check it out. I must admit, it‚Äôs very easy to get angry while playing it though

I loved hugging you too! We should have long hugs more often, it's really relaxing and I think less people care about it when they see us

I miss being able to hold you like that

[21-Dec-17 09:52 PM] josh#8811
It's this thing where you put your hands on the axle and you kind of do a sit-up but facing downward

[21-Dec-17 09:53 PM] josh#8811
I think it's more intense than sit-ups because sometimes it gives me way more pain than a burn, like I just strained something

Okay

Okay, so after I hit my crotch really bad on my bike crash I couldn't get a full rock hard erection and I thought it was because I broke my dick or something, but when I talked dirty with you for the first time I realized I just didn't have any passion in my life because you gave me a really strong hard on when I jerked off to us dirty texting, it was amazing

[21-Dec-17 10:42 PM] josh#8811
Looking back on it I thought it was sorta funny because no way I actually broke my dick

Ooh l wish I was the pillow

[21-Dec-17 10:46 PM] josh#8811

[21-Dec-17 10:48 PM] josh#8811
How wet are you?

[21-Dec-17 10:49 PM] josh#8811
I wish I could rub your clit through your underwear and hear you gasp and moan

[21-Dec-17 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I‚Äôve been this wet once or twice before, so it‚Äôs a little crazy. And I love the thought of that

[21-Dec-17 10:51 PM] josh#8811
You want a naughty picture to help you along?

[21-Dec-17 10:51 PM] josh#8811

Mmm I want you inside me so badly

[21-Dec-17 10:52 PM] josh#8811
I can't wait to slide my hard cock inside your wet pussy as we moan in pleasure

[21-Dec-17 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just moaned out loud reading that message

[21-Dec-17 10:55 PM] josh#8811
I want to carry you to your bedroom, lay you down on the floor, strip you down as fast as I can and fuck you until you orgasm, screaming my name

I want you to fuck me so badly, I want you to make me a moaning mess

[21-Dec-17 10:58 PM] josh#8811
I want to make a mess out of you darling, I want to fuck you until you can barely walk. I want to fuck you until you're covered in cum. I want to fuck you until we're covered in each other's sweat. I want to fuck you until we're so exhausted we just lay there while I'm still inside you, my cum dripping out of your ravaged pussy

[21-Dec-17 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh my god, I want you to fuck me so hard that I can‚Äôt walk the next day. Everything you just said sounds so appealing to me

[21-Dec-17 11:02 PM] josh#8811
I want to pound you with my dick so hard

[21-Dec-17 11:03 PM] josh#8811
I want to push you against a wall and rub your crotch until you can't stand it any more, and I want to fuck you in every position possible. I want to go all the way inside you

[21-Dec-17 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Mmm yes please, I would really enjoy you pinning me against the wall

[21-Dec-17 11:04 PM] josh#8811
I think about getting a little rough with you like that sometimes

[21-Dec-17 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah? Tell me more

[21-Dec-17 11:07 PM] josh#8811
Sometimes I think about pinning you against the floor or the wall by your wrists, and groping your chest and your pussy as you moan in pleasure. I want to tease you by sliding my hand up your inner thigh until it's right above your little love spot and you're arching your back in anticipation

[21-Dec-17 11:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd love that, it would drive me crazy

[21-Dec-17 11:08 PM] josh#8811

[21-Dec-17 11:10 PM] josh#8811
I really want to know what it feels like to have my hand gently wrapped around your soft neck as I kiss you and grope you. I want to caress it and squeeze it to make you feel good

[21-Dec-17 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oooh okay, I wouldn‚Äôt mind that at all

[21-Dec-17 11:11 PM] josh#8811

I always thought the couch was the first place where stuff would go down

[21-Dec-17 11:18 PM] josh#8811
Me too

Yeah, it is really comfortable

[21-Dec-17 11:19 PM] josh#8811

I'm panting a little thinking about that

I can‚Äôt wait either, I want you to make me feel good

Hmm, I‚Äôm not sure

[21-Dec-17 11:30 PM] josh#8811
I think I'd go down your throat a little if I went all the way in

[21-Dec-17 11:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I guess we will have to find that out when the time comes. Either way, I can promise you that it will feel nice

I know you'll make me feel good no matter what

Honestly I really want to see you in your wet underwear, or even more than that, but I also would go crazy for anything you sent, and I also love seeing your bare chest. But I think I want to see your wet tight love hole the most ‚ù§

I really like the thought of having my hand around your neck and pinning you with it, because it makes you so excited and vulnerable. I want to know if squeezing your neck would make you even more pleased and excited, I'm sort of just exploring it; honestly I don't think I'd enjoy it if you didn't enjoy it though

[23-Dec-17 11:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
What are your thoughts on hickeys?

[23-Dec-17 11:56 AM] josh#8811
I think I like giving them, especially on the neck. I'm kinda neutral about receiving them but that could change

[23-Dec-17 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, because I‚Äôd love for you to give me hickeys

[23-Dec-17 11:56 AM] josh#8811
I really want to give you hickeys too

[23-Dec-17 11:57 AM] josh#8811
I loved it when I gave you them on your neck

[23-Dec-17 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yay! I love it too, I enjoy any type of neck kissing but hickeys make me really excited

[23-Dec-17 11:58 AM] josh#8811
Hehe, do you want be to give you some today?

Maybe on my chest?

[23-Dec-17 07:58 PM] josh#8811
How big is the burn?

[23-Dec-17 07:58 PM] josh#8811
How bad does it look?

[23-Dec-17 07:59 PM] josh#8811
Do you have nail polish to seal the burn?

It stings so badly

[23-Dec-17 07:59 PM] josh#8811
Get some nail polish and put several layers on it

[23-Dec-17 07:59 PM] josh#8811
That will stop it from blistering too mich

[23-Dec-17 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt have any, I‚Äôm not at my house

[23-Dec-17 08:00 PM] josh#8811
Uh oh

[23-Dec-17 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôve just been running it under cold water and icing it

[23-Dec-17 08:00 PM] josh#8811
You're sure there's no nail polish?

[23-Dec-17 08:00 PM] josh#8811
That's good so far, good job

[23-Dec-17 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
No there‚Äôs not any around here

[23-Dec-17 08:01 PM] josh#8811
Nail polish isn't an essential thing but it would have stopped it from blistering as much, if you burn yourself next time then make sure to apply some immediately

[23-Dec-17 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, it‚Äôs also been a while

[23-Dec-17 08:01 PM] josh#8811
You can get a bowl with ice water and soak it in there

[23-Dec-17 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like 20 minutes

Oh wow

[23-Dec-17 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs gotten way worse though, it‚Äôs spreading to my hand

[23-Dec-17 08:02 PM] josh#8811
I think cold water will help but not much other than lidocaine

[23-Dec-17 08:02 PM] josh#8811
Oh no!

Agh

[23-Dec-17 08:03 PM] josh#8811
Do you know where aloe vera gel is? Some gels have lidocane which will relieve the pain

[23-Dec-17 08:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôll try to find something

Oh my God that's a really high temperature

[23-Dec-17 09:52 PM] josh#8811
Is that burn above your elbow, or above your knee?

[23-Dec-17 09:52 PM] josh#8811
Wait I'm so confused, do you have several places that got burned?

We could do that, and when I really start to get into it I could lay you down in the same position and pin you against the floor

[24-Dec-17 12:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
That sounds really nice, I‚Äôd definitely enjoy that üòç

Mmm, ill punish you even more if you do that

Good üòâ

[24-Dec-17 12:54 AM] josh#8811
Would you like it if I called you more dirty names, like slut? I'm thinking about exploring that to see if you'd enjoy it

[24-Dec-17 12:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, I‚Äôm down. Also, I want to be 100% serious with this and come up with ‚Äúbad things‚Äù to get punished for, like being too friendly with another boy or something. And if I break a rule I get punished üòâ

Oooh okay üòè

[24-Dec-17 12:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
So, you are the person in charge. What are the rules?

[24-Dec-17 12:57 AM] josh#8811
Hmmm

[24-Dec-17 12:59 AM] josh#8811
If you want to touch yourself you have to ask me first. You can't flirt with other boys or give them physical affection. Ill come up with more soon, but that's what I have for now. And if you break them you have to tell me, and I will punish you for being such a bad girl ‚ù§

[24-Dec-17 01:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, that sounds like a good start. Let me know if you come up with more

I can‚Äôt help it, daddy. You make me so wet

[24-Dec-17 01:05 AM] josh#8811
I don't care if you can't help it, I'm still going to spank you. I'm going to bend you over the couch, pull your pants and undies down and spank you until your butt is red.

[24-Dec-17 01:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, I‚Äôm sorry daddy. I‚Äôll only get really excited if you want me too

[24-Dec-17 01:09 AM] josh#8811
Well lucky for you, I want you to be very excited tonight. But the fact that you didn't ask me first makes me very angry. You make me so angry, I want to push you against the wall and choke you for being such a little horny girl without my permission

How about you have to tell me whenever your feeling horny?

You have to kiss me at least once a day each day I see you or else ill get very angry, and ill have to give you a spanking for not giving me the affection and love that I deserve

Hehe, what about it turns you on?

[24-Dec-17 01:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just the thought of you being really rough with me

[24-Dec-17 01:44 AM] josh#8811
Do you want me to shove you against the wall and choke you aggressively as I forcefully slide my hand down your pants?

[24-Dec-17 01:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Mmm yes I would like that

[24-Dec-17 01:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
I would love being shoved, pinned, spanked, and other similar things

Do you want to be slapped maybe?

[24-Dec-17 01:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Would you like that?

[24-Dec-17 01:47 AM] josh#8811
Hmmm, only if you would. I didn't think about slapping you until you said "similar things"

[24-Dec-17 01:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I would like it

[24-Dec-17 01:47 AM] josh#8811

[24-Dec-17 01:48 AM] josh#8811
What's that?

[24-Dec-17 01:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have to tell you who I‚Äôm texting or calling if you see me on my phone

[24-Dec-17 01:50 AM] josh#8811
Hmmm

[24-Dec-17 01:52 AM] josh#8811
You have to tell me whenever Spencer or any other boy outside your family starts texting you, and you can't text him/them first without asking me.

[24-Dec-17 01:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, sounds good

Actually you can't text them first without telling me first, just in case I can't respond to say Yes or no

[24-Dec-17 01:55 AM] josh#8811
You just have to tell me, but if I find out that you didn't then I will have to spank you for that

[24-Dec-17 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay. And how about the slapping comes in after 3 strikes?

[24-Dec-17 01:55 AM] josh#8811
Yeah, that sounds really good

[24-Dec-17 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay cool

[24-Dec-17 01:57 AM] josh#8811
I've never slapped anyone before so I don't know how hard it will be the first few times (same with spanking, I think choking is different though) but I can assure you I will slap and spank you harder when I get used to the feeling

[24-Dec-17 01:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
I can understand that. With spanking you don‚Äôt have to worry at all though, the harder the better

[24-Dec-17 01:58 AM] josh#8811
I'm definitely not as worried about the spanking

[24-Dec-17 01:59 AM] josh#8811

I can‚Äôt wait either

[24-Dec-17 01:59 AM] josh#8811
God I want to fuck you right now, I just can't stop thinking about pinning you to the ground by your neck, stripping your clothes off of you and forcing my hard penis into your wet vagina as you moan in pleasure. I want to feel you writhing around as I thrust myself inside you, back and forth

[24-Dec-17 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
That sounds so nice, I really want you to fuck me too. I can‚Äôt wait for us to have that opportunity

Mmm, naughty girl. I will punish you very strictly if you break them

[24-Dec-17 02:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
What are all of your punishments?

[24-Dec-17 02:09 AM] josh#8811 (pinned)
First strike is a big spank on the ass, ten times. Second strike is ten spanks and choking you while pinning you down for fifteen seconds. Third strike is all of the second, but double of each and I slap you afterwards

[24-Dec-17 02:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, that sounds good. Do I have to thank you after each spanking?

[24-Dec-17 02:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Pinned a message.

[24-Dec-17 02:13 AM] josh#8811
I may spank you even if you haven't broken any rules, to make you even more horny before we fool around or even during it

[24-Dec-17 02:13 AM] josh#8811
Same with choking

I don‚Äôt know, pretty much anything you tell me to do. It could range from asking me to get you something to asking me to take off my clothes

I was talking with ivonne and did you know people shipped us like back when I met up with you during lunch privately the first time?

[24-Dec-17 10:00 PM] josh#8811
Ivonne even predicted that you'd break up with Spencer, like 2 weeks before Thanksgiving break apparently

[24-Dec-17 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh wow, that‚Äôs crazy

I did not know that lol

[24-Dec-17 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wonder who talked about us

[24-Dec-17 10:02 PM] josh#8811
I'll have to ask Ivonne some more about it

[24-Dec-17 10:02 PM] josh#8811
I'm really interested about it

[24-Dec-17 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Me too! Now that I know about it I must know more

[24-Dec-17 10:03 PM] josh#8811

[24-Dec-17 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah?

[24-Dec-17 10:04 PM] josh#8811
So, she predicted about 2 weeks before Thanksgiving break that you'd break up with your ex and start dating me before the end of the year, and she told them but they didn't believe her. And then when you broke up she said to them "didn't I tell you so?"

[24-Dec-17 10:05 PM] josh#8811
So now, I think everyone suspects what's happening

[24-Dec-17 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ooooh that‚Äôs really crazy

[24-Dec-17 10:05 PM] josh#8811
Because they know one part of Ivonne's prediction came true

[24-Dec-17 10:05 PM] josh#8811
Yeah right?

[24-Dec-17 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
How on earth did she know this haha

[24-Dec-17 10:06 PM] josh#8811
I think she's pretty psychic or something

Oh yeah, her family does palm reading and stuff

[24-Dec-17 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs more realistic

[24-Dec-17 10:07 PM] josh#8811
I didn't even see this coming to be honest, it's really crazy how good her predictions are

[24-Dec-17 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah it‚Äôs cool how she was able to predict this

[24-Dec-17 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn‚Äôt see it either. I saw myself breaking up with Spencer, but you were a pleasant surprise

[24-Dec-17 10:09 PM] josh#8811
Yay! I didn't even see your breakup coming

[24-Dec-17 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000

Did you forget, or did you wait on purpose?

[24-Dec-17 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I forgot, I swear. My evening has been super busy, I was baking cookies

[24-Dec-17 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
But I won‚Äôt retaliate if punishment is necessary

[24-Dec-17 10:16 PM] josh#8811
Okay, good. It's okay if you forget every once in a while, but if you do it again soon then you'll get punished for it. This can't go unpunished, but I'm not going to get too mad. I'll give you only a couple of spanks, because it was an accident.

[24-Dec-17 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000

Hmmm, I'm not sure

[24-Dec-17 10:21 PM] josh#8811

Hmm

[24-Dec-17 10:22 PM] josh#8811
Heh, this is tough

[24-Dec-17 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I would imagine most people who do this have a house where they could privately do this

[24-Dec-17 10:23 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, yeah I'd assume so

[24-Dec-17 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
We could always plan more hang outs or something

[24-Dec-17 10:25 PM] josh#8811
Yeah true

[24-Dec-17 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because say we were at Maja‚Äôs house for example, you could grab my wrist and take me outside

[24-Dec-17 10:26 PM] josh#8811
Hmmm, that could work

[24-Dec-17 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or if we were out doing something we could go to the bathroom

[24-Dec-17 10:27 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, true

[24-Dec-17 10:27 PM] josh#8811
This could work out

[24-Dec-17 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. And don‚Äôt be afraid to be rough with me, if you think I‚Äôm being naughty just firmly ask me to come with you üòâ

[24-Dec-17 10:28 PM] josh#8811
I won't be afraid, and I'll definitely tell you to come with me if you're being naughty

Okay, and I might resist to make you drag me out of the situation and be more rough üòè

[24-Dec-17 10:30 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, okay üòè

But if you genuinely don't feel good about it like if it's not a good time you should tell me so I don't hurt you the wrong way

[24-Dec-17 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, thanks but don‚Äôt worry. It honestly really turns me on

[24-Dec-17 10:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I fantasize a lot about you being very dominant and controlling like that

[24-Dec-17 10:32 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, good

[24-Dec-17 10:32 PM] josh#8811
I'll be sure to dominate you then, even if you resist

Yes please üòä

And what if I resist?

[24-Dec-17 10:34 PM] josh#8811
Then I'll go even harder

[24-Dec-17 10:35 PM] josh#8811
This sounds really good, I think we definitely need a safe word though cause I could do something unconsentual without realizing it

[24-Dec-17 10:36 PM] josh#8811
And that's my worst fear

[24-Dec-17 10:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay. I don‚Äôt foresee that happening, but maybe a safe word could be ‚Äúred‚Äù or something. I thought it could be that because red, hurt, you know?

[24-Dec-17 10:38 PM] josh#8811
Yeah that's a good one, red

[24-Dec-17 10:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay. If you think you have a better one, let me know. I was just thinking off the top of my head

[24-Dec-17 10:39 PM] josh#8811
Okay, awesome

[24-Dec-17 10:39 PM] josh#8811
Thank you, having that failsafe, it's really important to me

I know you are sleeping, but I thought of one more thing punishment-wise. I‚Äôd like you to grab my chin harshly to look at you if you are mad at me and you are telling me that I broke the rules

I'm at my dad's, so we spent a good portion of today cleaning the house and doing the dishes in preparation for his colleagues to come over for dinner. My little sister had a meltdown and begged my dad to go back to our mom's house. I'm pretty stressed, because we're both going to be here for most of the week and I don't want to, but I also don't want to be at my mother's either because it's almost as stressful. I just feel like I need to spend a day in the woods away from my family and destress

[25-Dec-17 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
What would happen?

[25-Dec-17 10:21 PM] josh#8811
I'd come in, and immediately start kissing you. I'd have my hands all over you, I'd be groping your butt and I'd feel your waist and chest. Then, I'd grab your wrist and take you to the living room, where I'd grab your chin and tell you how you've been a bad girl and it's time for your punishment

Ooh, that sounds very nice üòç

[25-Dec-17 10:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
What would happen next?

[25-Dec-17 10:25 PM] josh#8811
I'd bend you over the end of the couch and I'd grab your butt, and squeeze it. I'd aggressively pull down your pants and underwear, and I'd feel your bare ass. Then, I'd give it a nice slap. Then, I'd slap it even harder, and harder until there's a big red handprint on one of your cheeks. Then, I'd move to the other cheek and immediately slap it very very hard. Id slap it a few times more, and then I'd spread your legs and cheeks to see how wet you are.

[25-Dec-17 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
What would happen?

[25-Dec-17 10:30 PM] josh#8811
I would rub your wet pussy a little, and then I'd stick my fingers in my mouth to taste you. Then, I'd pull your pants up, force you to stand up, and I'd pick you up so that your crotch is rubbing against mine. I'd carry you like that to your room, and when we'd get in there I'd slam you against a wall and start kissing you while grinding against you. After a minute or two of that, I'd pin you down on the floor by your neck and choke you for a good thirty seconds, while taking your pants off.

[25-Dec-17 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh my god, that sounds so nice. I would absolutely love that, it would drive me crazy

[25-Dec-17 10:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
What would happen once my pants are off?

[25-Dec-17 10:36 PM] josh#8811
I would strip my shirt, pants and underwear off as well, and I'd take your shirt and bra off so that we're both naked. I'd pin you down again, this time by your wrists, and id kiss you while pressing my body against yours. My hard penis would be so close your wet vagina, it would drive us both crazy with lust. I would start to kiss your neck, and I would kiss my way down to your breasts. Then, I would give you hickeys all over your chest, and I would suck on your nipples. I would kiss my way all the way down your sexy torso, and I would stop right above your wet vagina.

[25-Dec-17 10:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
That sounds so great, I‚Äôd love to be naked and pinned down by you. The thought of you leaving kisses all the way down my body really gets me excited ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I can't wait to be naked with you in real life

I can‚Äôt wait either, it will be so nice

[25-Dec-17 11:06 PM] josh#8811
Do you want be to continue with what would happen after I would carry you to your room?

So, I would kiss my way down to your wet aching vulva. Then, I would lift up one of your legs and slowly kiss my way down your thigh. I would leave a hickey right next to your vulva. Then, I would spread your legs and rub your clit with the tip of my tongue. I would gently press against it, and slowly flick it and rub my tongue against it. I would take my two fingers and slowly push them into your love hole, and slide them in and out as I licked you.

[25-Dec-17 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
That sounds like heaven, I moaned reading that. Having you kiss down my thigh would make me so wet

[25-Dec-17 11:12 PM] josh#8811
Mmm, naughty girl. I can't wait to do all of those things. Do you want to know what I'd do next?

[25-Dec-17 11:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
What would you do next?

[25-Dec-17 11:16 PM] josh#8811
After a few minutes of that, I would kiss you on the lips and spread your legs some more. I'd pin you down by your neck, and I'd choke you as I place my hard penis right on front of the opening of your vagina. I would slowly push the head in so that it's soaked by your juices, and then with one hard stroke, I would shove my entire length inside you. I would leave it in there for a second or two, so that I can feel how tight and warm you are. Then, I would thrust myself back and forth, all while tightening my grip on your neck. You would let out gasps of pleasure as you would struggle to breathe.

My goodness, if you could recreate this in real life I would absolutely love that

[25-Dec-17 11:18 PM] josh#8811
I would probably cum before this, but I would still be able to recreate it since I can cum multiple times in a session

Hehe how long do you think you‚Äôll last the first time we have real sexual contact?

[25-Dec-17 11:20 PM] josh#8811
Once I'm fully erect, not even like five minutes. You turn me on so much just by giving me messages and pictures, I have no idea what physical contact will do

[25-Dec-17 11:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Haha I can‚Äôt wait to find out

[25-Dec-17 11:21 PM] josh#8811
I mean, the fun won't be over after I cum the first time, so you don't have to worry about that, but I'm just saying you make my blow my load really easily

I‚Äôd have a high chance of getting pregnant

I mean, if you had birth control lol

[25-Dec-17 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I‚Äôm not taking it anymore. If I was taking it, it has a 98% efficiency

[25-Dec-17 11:23 PM] josh#8811
Hmmm, okay we have to be careful then if you're not on it when we're alone for the first time

[25-Dec-17 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can‚Äôt be on it for extended periods of time because it decreases my chances of getting pregnant and breastfeeding when I want children

[25-Dec-17 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, and we will need protection for sure

[25-Dec-17 11:25 PM] josh#8811

Once I reached your jeans, I would pull them off in one swift motion. I‚Äôd palm you through your boxers teasingly while giving you kisses. I‚Äôd then pull down your boxers and take your hard cock in my mouth. I‚Äôd leave kisses on your tip and all the way down to the base. I would start bobbing my head up and down while you tangle your hands in my hair

[25-Dec-17 11:35 PM] josh#8811
Oh my goodness, I want that so badly. I moaned while reading that and I'm getting close again

I would love for you to have me pinned and start to fuck me. You would be slamming into me while we are both moaning messes. My nails would dig into your back as you squeeze my neck. This would continue until you feel yourself getting really close. Then you would pull out and cum all over my chest

What do you think made it so good?

[25-Dec-17 11:45 PM] josh#8811
The way that you talked dirty to me really helped, and how you really appealed to my wants. Plus, I was jacking off for a very long time beforehand and having that buildup helps a lot

It was mostly back and forth, I don‚Äôt really need to stick and finger inside. I rubbed my fingers through my folds and then focus on my clitoris. I rubbed it back and forth for a little while. It also feels really good when I pat it harshly, it sends little shocks through my body

[26-Dec-17 12:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I‚Äôve only done that once before. Vaginas are weird in the way that they have a little protective thing that hurts when it tears, so I bled one time. It has scarred me

[26-Dec-17 12:18 AM] josh#8811
Hehe, I think you broke your hymen

[26-Dec-17 12:18 AM] josh#8811
It might not bleed when I go inside you for the first time, which isn't bad

It's pretty late, do you want to keep talking? I want to talk if you do

Yay!

[26-Dec-17 12:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah!

[26-Dec-17 12:25 AM] josh#8811
Oh you know something a little strange but good I realized about myself?

[26-Dec-17 12:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
What is that?

[26-Dec-17 12:26 AM] josh#8811
So, you know the stereotype on men about how after sex they just go to sleep immediately?

[26-Dec-17 12:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[26-Dec-17 12:27 AM] josh#8811
Okay, so that used to hit me hard in real life, like it's a thing for hormones to be released to make me sleepy afterwards. But now, I don't feel tired at all after I finish, and I'm really happy that's the case; a few years ago, I could barely keep my eyes open by now

[26-Dec-17 12:28 AM] josh#8811
It's kind of random but I thought it was cool

[26-Dec-17 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh wow, that‚Äôs pretty interesting

[26-Dec-17 12:28 AM] josh#8811
Yeah

[26-Dec-17 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt feel super sleepy. But, I usually take Benadryl before bed and I forgot tonight

[26-Dec-17 12:29 AM] josh#8811
Heh, thats like how English people have a nightcap (small amount of alcohol) to help them sleep

[26-Dec-17 12:29 AM] josh#8811
My dad offers me that sometimes but I always refuse

[26-Dec-17 12:30 AM] josh#8811
Is it like a NyQuil?

[26-Dec-17 12:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
I always take Benadryl because I have a hard time falling asleep. It‚Äôs an anti-allergy, so it makes you sleepy

[26-Dec-17 12:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
I took melatonin but my body got used to it

[26-Dec-17 12:31 AM] josh#8811
Ohhh, interesting. I fall asleep listening to music, and that helps me fall asleep after like 30 minutes of trying to but my thoughts always keep me up without it

[26-Dec-17 12:31 AM] josh#8811
I take melatonin every now and then as well

[26-Dec-17 12:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh dear, your thoughts keep you up?

[26-Dec-17 12:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
I sometimes have racing thoughts before bed

[26-Dec-17 12:33 AM] josh#8811
I used to have it a lot worse before I listened to music, they'd always be really negative thoughts and sometimes I'd get pretty anxious because I'd get stressed out by all of it

[26-Dec-17 12:33 AM] josh#8811
But the music gives me something to concentrate on and it helps

[26-Dec-17 12:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs good. Maybe you could try hydroxyzine

[26-Dec-17 12:35 AM] josh#8811
Hmm, maybe. I think it was because of my depression and all that; I've noticed I don't get those thoughts nearly as much but if they come back I'll definitely consider it

[26-Dec-17 12:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, well that‚Äôs good

[26-Dec-17 12:35 AM] josh#8811

I wanted to say that I love you so much. You mean the world to me, and I am very glad to hear that the Zoloft is working. I'm so happy that we are together, and that things are getting better for the both of us. Tonight was so fun! I'm really giddy that we were able to help each other finish, because it means a lot to me that you get that satisfaction. I hope you sleep really well, and I wish I could give you a hug and a kiss goodnight. I love you darling ‚ô•Ô∏è

Josh, I love you with all my heart. Your kindness and support has helped me so much, and I hope it goes the same for you. You make me so happy, and you have given me pleasure in ways I‚Äôve never felt before - and you haven‚Äôt even done much yet. Our compatibility and sexual interests make me so happy because I know we will easily make each other very satisfied. I had a really nice time tonight, as I said before that was my best orgasm yet, I‚Äôm still feeling aftershocks from it. I wish you nice dreams and a good nights‚Äô sleep. I love you so much! üòò

Did you say you were still feeling after shocks from your orgasm? I'm a little curious haha

[26-Dec-17 01:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well it stopped, hmm it‚Äôs hard to explain. So you know that feeling when you orgasm? It‚Äôs little little versions of that shooting up my body every once in a while

[26-Dec-17 01:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it‚Äôs because of how intense it was

[26-Dec-17 01:04 AM] josh#8811
Ooooh, that sounds nice üòä

[26-Dec-17 01:04 AM] Deleted User#0000

[26-Dec-17 01:04 AM] josh#8811
I don't think I get that

[26-Dec-17 01:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
It was very nice. I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a girl because it‚Äôs like the feeling I get when something turns me on

[26-Dec-17 01:05 AM] josh#8811
Wow, lucky haha

[26-Dec-17 01:05 AM] josh#8811
After I orgasm my dick usually stops being hard and I just feel really relaxed

[26-Dec-17 01:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
What does an orgasm feel like as a boy lol

[26-Dec-17 01:06 AM] josh#8811
Hmmm

[26-Dec-17 01:06 AM] josh#8811
It's all in the dick, there's no shooting feeling in any other part if the body

[26-Dec-17 01:07 AM] josh#8811
And it feels really good as my dick pulses as my cum shoots out, that's the best part as the muscles for that contract

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Huh, that‚Äôs interesting. It‚Äôs pretty different for me because I don‚Äôt have a separate body part

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] josh#8811
And everything becomes really sensitive during it so when I touch myself during it it's really really good

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] josh#8811
Huh, yeah

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs similar to touching my clitoris

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] josh#8811
Oops I'm getting horny again thinking about it üòÖ

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] Deleted User#0000

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] josh#8811
It might be, yeah

[26-Dec-17 01:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Because that‚Äôs really sensitive

[26-Dec-17 01:09 AM] josh#8811
I hear that the clit has way more nerve endings than the head of the dick, but they could be similar in sensation

[26-Dec-17 01:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs true

[26-Dec-17 01:09 AM] josh#8811
For me, I don't rub my head with my hand directly cause I'm uncircumcised so I have foreskin for it

[26-Dec-17 01:10 AM] josh#8811
But I've used lube and when I do it feels amazing, because it's closer to penetration

[26-Dec-17 01:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[26-Dec-17 01:10 AM] Deleted User#0000

It is, heh

[26-Dec-17 01:11 AM] Deleted User#0000

Haha

[26-Dec-17 01:11 AM] josh#8811
I love hearing about how it feels when you masturbate too, it's really interesting for me as well

[26-Dec-17 01:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
It would be much easier for me to explain in person though haha, it‚Äôs hard to describe without pointing to stuff

[26-Dec-17 01:13 AM] josh#8811
We should do it sometime, like show each other while naked

[26-Dec-17 01:13 AM] Deleted User#0000

I‚Äôm sure it would get really dirty really fast

[26-Dec-17 01:14 AM] josh#8811
Yeah I bet haha

[26-Dec-17 01:14 AM] josh#8811
For me, when I get horny I feel like I need to stick my dick inside something, immediately, it's a pretty big feeling

[26-Dec-17 01:15 AM] josh#8811
Cause my instincts are yelling at me to shoot my load inside everything I can

[26-Dec-17 01:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm interesting lol. For me it‚Äôs the need to be touched and have something inside me

[26-Dec-17 01:16 AM] josh#8811
Like you have a need to have physical contact all over?

[26-Dec-17 01:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
No, just on my vagina. Like I need to be constantly touched

[26-Dec-17 01:17 AM] josh#8811
Ohhh hehe

[26-Dec-17 01:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or else it will ache

[26-Dec-17 01:17 AM] josh#8811
Oh really?

[26-Dec-17 01:17 AM] josh#8811
Like a painful ache?

[26-Dec-17 01:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, there have been times where I‚Äôve been so turned on and wet that it‚Äôs so sensitive. Not necessary painful, it‚Äôs dull

[26-Dec-17 01:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs pretty hard to describe

[26-Dec-17 01:18 AM] josh#8811
And you also need something inside you too?

[26-Dec-17 01:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes

[26-Dec-17 01:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like something that my fingers can not replace

[26-Dec-17 01:20 AM] josh#8811
Like your insides need to be stretched a little by a nice penis? (Sorry I'm gonna be honest, I'm jerking off again I couldn't help it, and this conversation is really getting me off learning about how you feel)

[26-Dec-17 01:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, exactly like that

[26-Dec-17 01:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
And whenever I get to that point, all I can think about is how yours would do the job quite nicely

[26-Dec-17 01:22 AM] josh#8811

[26-Dec-17 01:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay!

[26-Dec-17 01:24 AM] josh#8811
So, I feel like I really need to slide my dick into a pussy, specifically yours. My hand does not do the same job as a wet tight warm pussy, and I'm sure it would feel a lot better because my head of my dick would get rubbed directly

[26-Dec-17 01:24 AM] josh#8811
All the sensation is in my penis, nowhere else

[26-Dec-17 01:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, pretty interesting. Well it would make sense for the sensation to be in my body because vaginas are internal

[26-Dec-17 01:25 AM] josh#8811
Yeah, that does make sense

[26-Dec-17 01:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
And I‚Äôm glad that you instantly think about me when you are masturbating üòä

[26-Dec-17 01:26 AM] josh#8811
I can't think about anyone else but you

[26-Dec-17 01:27 AM] josh#8811
I've tried watching porn like after the first time we talked dirty, but my mind just drifted to thinking about you and I turned it off and came to you. The porn actually didn't even compare, you do wonders on me

That makes me very flattered

Hmmm, I actually don't know. I I've thought about doing some stuff before like this one kink where the sub acts almost like an animal and wears a collar, but I've thought about it some more and it's not really appealing to me now as it was like a year ago

I can‚Äôt wait to give you more kisses and hugs, I will never not want to kiss you. Seeing your face makes me so happy, whether it‚Äôs a nice picture or a sexy one. I want to plan cute dates, sneak kisses when we are out with friends, cuddle and giggle for hours on end. I know we haven‚Äôt been together for long, but I can tell you are something special. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but you give me something I have never received before, and I love it

[28-Dec-17 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Our silly conversations, like calling each other a snacc or teasing each other in person, absolutely make my day. No joke, your smile could light up the darkest room in the world.

Hannah, I love you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è. Whenever I'm with you, all of my problems fade away and my feelings are only of ecstacy and love. Whenever you send me any picture, be it of your face or your body, I always break out into a smile and my heart warms so much. I can't wait to plan dates, and I can't wait to sneak more kisses and holds hands when we're out with our friends. It's absolutely amazing how close we've grown together in such a short time frame, and I love that we have; I have never been this close to anyone in my entire life before I met you.

Oh yeah, forgive me for not giving you a report of the evening. Overall I had a pretty good time, but Spencer was a little too close for comfort. He laid right next to me o the couch. There was one time where he grabbed my thigh and rested his head on my knee. He hugged me for too long at the end, I tried letting go and I even tickled him but he wouldn‚Äôt let go.

[29-Dec-17 10:00 AM] josh#8811
I really don't like the sound of that. Thank you for telling me what happened. I think that you should tell him how his physical contact makes you feel uncomfortable if he keeps doing it. I'm pretty sure he'll stop once we're dating out in the open, but if he doesn't then that's going to be a big problem. I love you ‚ô•Ô∏è

Aww üòä

[29-Dec-17 10:13 AM] josh#8811
It's the same with me, because whenever I cum by looking at your pictures or by reading what you said it's not as good as when you're actually talking with me

[29-Dec-17 10:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I completely get that. I mean, I was touching myself for several minutes and nothing was happening. I absolutely loved the photos, but I need that connection I guess

How has your day been?

[29-Dec-17 04:45 PM] josh#8811
Pretty bad, to be honest. My mom sent me an email about my independent study and I got really angry at her and was just in a general bad mood, and then my dad kept asking me what was wrong when we were driving to pick up something from my mom's, and I told him I didn't feel like talking, and then he just decided that was the best time to suggest that I see a therapist. So, I got even more angry because my mom's on my back, and my dad isn't really letting me leave the house because I don't have any lights on my bike, so I just feel trapped and alone

I can‚Äôt wait

[29-Dec-17 09:23 PM] josh#8811
Would you like it if I slid a finger inside you?

[29-Dec-17 09:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would. The real question is: will you be rough or gentle?

[29-Dec-17 09:24 PM] josh#8811
Gentle at first when it comes to the fingering, unless you want it to be rough

[29-Dec-17 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm, well it depends. I want you to be gentle when we are sweet with each other but as soon as I get turned on I want to be really rough

[29-Dec-17 09:26 PM] josh#8811
That sounds like a nice balance, I would like that too

[29-Dec-17 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[29-Dec-17 09:27 PM] josh#8811
You should tell me if I rub you too hard though, cause I don't know how sensitive you are initially

[29-Dec-17 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah it hurts if you rub back and forth hard, but if it‚Äôs like pushing your fingers in and out I don‚Äôt mind

[29-Dec-17 09:28 PM] josh#8811
Okay, I'll remember that üòö

[29-Dec-17 09:28 PM] josh#8811
I can't wait to slide my fingers inside you

[29-Dec-17 09:31 PM] Deleted User#0000

[29-Dec-17 09:37 PM] josh#8811
And then, I would hover my mouth right above you and breathe hot breathe right on your love spot

Mmm, I bet you would

[29-Dec-17 09:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or I would push my body up to meet your mouth

[29-Dec-17 09:39 PM] josh#8811
I would force your legs apart even more and I'd drool right onto you to tease you even more

[29-Dec-17 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000

I would trace my tongue around your love spot too, just barely missing it

[29-Dec-17 09:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
You love the thought of teasing me, don‚Äôt you? Having me beg you to touch me

Okay, what are you suggesting by ‚Äúsomething harder?‚Äù

[29-Dec-17 10:48 PM] josh#8811
Actually, I'm not sure. Like, I was originally suggesting leaving marks from spanking you but I wasn't sure if you want me to leave like, bruises or something like that, so I was asking if you wanted something like that; I don't know if I want it myself, definitely not if you wouldn't enjoy it, but I'm open to it

[29-Dec-17 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, I definitely don‚Äôt feel like having you seriously hurt me. I don‚Äôt mind spanking/slapping or hickeys though

[29-Dec-17 10:50 PM] josh#8811
Okay, thank you very much for the clarification. I don't want to give you any serious marks or hurt you seriously either. I was just a little confused by what you were implying when you asked what kind of marks, and I feel really guilty that I even suggested what I did

Hannah, you mean so much to me. I can't wait to wrap you in a big hug when I see you, and I can't wait to feel your warmth again. All I want to do is be with you, and live in the moment. I love knowing that you are mine and I am yours, I love everything about you, I love you. I can't wait to go on dates, I want to walk around the city at night holding hands with you. I want to cuddle on the couch with you during a rainy day, I want to sit and listen to music with you, and I want to joke around with you like we always do. I wish I could be with you forever. I love you so much Hannah, and I can't wait to see you at the party. I don't care if other people see, I want to hold hands and hug you. I can't wait to give you kisses and wrap my arms around you. 
You make me feel better whenever I'm with you. You are the light of my life, and I never want to let you go. I only want to give you joy, and pleasure, and nothing but positive feelings. My biggest fear is losing you because of something I've done wrong, and I know it's unlikely for that to happen but it still eats away at me with every message I send to you. I guess the way I've grown up has influenced me to always have that fear. I just can't wait to strengthen our relationship even more, and I can't wait to spend more time with you. I love you, Hannah. I love you so much

So I was doing a cross country race and I barely beat my friend for 2nd place. I was really happy to see her so we hugged and stuff. Then I remember being in a library. She wanted to play a game that‚Äôs like whenever I look at a certain person I get punished. So I looked at them. The person grabbed my neck and she started kissing me? I don‚Äôt really remember. So my friend found out and we went into a changing area in a library? It‚Äôs pretty random but made sense at the time. We tried on constumes

So, my mom took us to this really nice modern vacation home out of the blue, and you and your family were there too in a different home, like next door. I walked outside to take photos, because it was really beautiful; there was a modern garden with planter boxes that had romaine lettuce and all kinds of vegetables, and everything was so clean and tidy, and the sun was starting to set. So, somehow I went into your guys' house, and I was sitting on your bed with you, like we were about to fall asleep or something. And we were flirting and laughing, and then your mom walked in and I got really scared/sad because I knew I had to leave. But then, she looked at you and said "he's making a cute face," which really confused me. Then she said something along the lines of that we're aloud to be together or flirt or something, and I just felt really relieved that she was okay with it now. Like, I thought it was so real that when I woke up I took a few seconds to realize it was a dream.

I wish I slide my hand up your thigh, closer and closer to your love spot...

[30-Dec-17 11:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
I probably would have moaned out loud. It actually made me a little wet, because all I could think about was your hand inching closer and closer

Oh my god üòç

It‚Äôs just, I‚Äôve fallen for every part of you. The way you giggle when you are nervous, how you smile when you see me, your laugh, the way you smell (it instantly relaxes me), your kisses, the way your hand fits with mine, your hugs, the way you dress, your hair, the way your eyes squint when you smile

I love your laugh, I love the way you cock your head and smile at me when we're about to kiss, I love the way you wrap your arms around me... Your smell is so intoxicatingly good, it's hypnotizing.

[01-Jan-18 12:30 AM] josh#8811
so we were in my room at my dad's with some other friends, but for some reason it was actually "school," even though it was in the house and everything. You and I were sitting next to each other, and we decided to go into an empty room next to my bedroom. We locked the door and I immidiatley started making out with you. Things got hot really fast, we were on the floor grinding against each other, and then we stood up and I had you pinned to the wall by your neck. I was kissing you and choking you, and then you gestured for me to stop so I did. But then you told me to keep going, and a few seconds later you said that you were having an orgasm. We somehow teleported to you sitting on my lap on the floor while you were still having it, and we grinded together as you let out a really cute moan. After that we cuddled and I woke up super horny

So when we were at my moms race, my dad and I walked around a bit. Since it was in San Francisco, there is quite a few homeless people as you know. Well there a was a guy on the sidewalk who was clearly on something. He randomly yelled out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a child molester!‚Äù Twice. And when my dad and I passed by he looked at me and said ‚Äúyo FUCK Batman!‚Äù And he said that several times. And when we had to go back on that road later my dad was like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hope Batman‚Äôs nemesis isn‚Äôt there‚Äù

[01-Jan-18 12:52 AM] josh#8811

[01-Jan-18 12:57 AM] josh#8811
it was kind of so so; i woke up and as soon as i came down my dad told me im staying here until i finish some independent study work. after that we went on a walk and i was feeling just stressed out and mad in general, but i got to take some good photos at least. after that it mellowed out, i just sat on front of a screen. also my phone got taken away üò¶

I would love to be with you home alone for a whole day, where we would be naked the entire time. It would start out with us making out and groping each other, and you would sit on my lap facing me while i gave you kisses leading to your breasts. i would give you hickeys and i would suck on your nipples, and then i would lay you down and kiss down to your sexy abdomen, closer and closer to your love hole ‚ù§. I'd start to eat you out, and I would hear you moaning as I slid my fingers in and out of you. After some of that, you would get up and start to blow me. It would eventually lead to us having sex, and I'm sure it would feel amazing

[02-Jan-18 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh no! Why?

[02-Jan-18 11:19 AM] josh#8811
I tried falling asleep around 9:30 by listening to music, but I couldn't stop thinking about stuff. There's this one thing I do to calm myself down, which helps sometimes; I imagine I'm writing everything down or explaining why I feel so anxious. Heh, it's sort of a virtual therapy. I have a lot of mixed feelings when it comes to my current relationship with your family (especially your mother), and I started to think about what I would write if I wrote her a sort of apology letter. I think I'm kind of stressed about how I'm going to imrove my relationship with your mom

[02-Jan-18 11:20 AM] josh#8811
So, I was thinking and thinking, and I checked the time after a while and it was like 12:30

[02-Jan-18 11:20 AM] josh#8811
I turned off my music and finally tried to just sleep, and I probably fell asleep around 1

[02-Jan-18 11:21 AM] josh#8811
then, my dad woke me up at like 6:30 because he's going back to work and he wants me up at the same time

[02-Jan-18 11:23 AM] josh#8811
Thank you, it's okay

[02-Jan-18 11:23 AM] josh#8811
I think I just need to wait things out, let the dust settle

[02-Jan-18 11:24 AM] josh#8811

Apple is actually offering 29 dollar battery replacements for the iPhone 6 and up because they were hit with lawsuits for slowing down phones with old batteries, so this is actually the perfect time for this to happen to you if it had to üòÖ   but that still really sucks though, agh

[03-Jan-18 11:12 AM] josh#8811
Have you been taking vitamins and stuff?

[03-Jan-18 11:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
I am going to take Advil once I get out of bed

[03-Jan-18 11:12 AM] josh#8811
That's good

[03-Jan-18 11:12 AM] josh#8811
If you take vitamin c it can help too

[03-Jan-18 11:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah, my parents have a powder you can mix into water that has a ton of vitamins and stuff

[03-Jan-18 11:13 AM] josh#8811
Oh that's great!

[03-Jan-18 11:14 AM] josh#8811
You should be taking that, I'm sure it would help üòä

I would love to be making out with you, and then have you pick me up and pin me against the wall

I can't wait either darling üòò

[03-Jan-18 11:26 AM] josh#8811
I can't wait to grab your neck and pin you against the wall, and hear you struggle to breathe as I squeeze it harder

[03-Jan-18 11:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh my goodness, I‚Äôd really enjoy that

[03-Jan-18 11:28 AM] josh#8811
I'd enjoy it too, very much. I can't wait to do it to you

[03-Jan-18 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd really enjoy kissing you and having you grab my butt. And then having you lay me down on the floor and strip me of my clothes

[03-Jan-18 11:30 AM] josh#8811
I want to grab and slap your butt, and strip you down naked before I pin you against the floor and grope and kiss you all over

[03-Jan-18 11:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd enjoy that so much. I want to feel your hands and lips all over my body

[03-Jan-18 11:33 AM] josh#8811
I want to start by kissing your neck, down to your collar bone. I want to kiss my way to your breasts, and I would leave hickeys all over. I would massage them and I would lick and suck on your nipples

[03-Jan-18 11:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
The thought of it made me moan a little

[03-Jan-18 11:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
I would absolutely love that

[03-Jan-18 11:34 AM] josh#8811
I would love it too, I'm touching myself thinking of it

Good üòò

[03-Jan-18 11:36 AM] josh#8811
Want to know what I'd do next?

[03-Jan-18 11:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
What would you do?

[03-Jan-18 11:39 AM] josh#8811
After kissing your breasts, I would kiss my way down to your tummy and then to your waist. I would take one of your legs, and I would start to kiss my way all the way down your inner thigh, staring from your knee. My kisses would get sloppier and slower as I got closer and closer to your love hole ‚ô•Ô∏è. I would move my head away right as I'm about to reach it, and I would drool some saliva right onto your clit. I would bring my face closer, and I'd hold your legs and waist down as I breathe my hot breath onto your pussy

[03-Jan-18 11:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
My goodness, I love the thought of that. I‚Äôd be begging for you to touch me at that point

[03-Jan-18 11:41 AM] josh#8811
Good, I want you to beg

[03-Jan-18 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
What if I tried to push your head down haha

[03-Jan-18 11:42 AM] josh#8811
I'd let you push it so I'm very close, but just far enough for nothing to touch. Then I'd stick my tongue out and barely run it up your folds

[03-Jan-18 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oooh ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[03-Jan-18 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd definitely be moaning at this point

[03-Jan-18 11:44 AM] josh#8811
I'm glad

[03-Jan-18 11:44 AM] josh#8811
You know what I'd do next?

[03-Jan-18 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
What?

[03-Jan-18 11:46 AM] josh#8811
I would lean in, press my lips against your pussy, and I'd start to kiss it. I'd press my tongue against your clit as I moved my lips

[03-Jan-18 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
I would love that so much. I‚Äôd probably put my hands in your hair and gently pull at it

[03-Jan-18 11:47 AM] josh#8811
Oooh üòä

[03-Jan-18 11:47 AM] josh#8811
I would stick my tongue out and gently give your pussy big laps

[03-Jan-18 11:48 AM] josh#8811
My hands would be on your inner thighs, keeping them spread open

[03-Jan-18 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh my goodness, what if you were doing that and fingering me at the same time üòç

[03-Jan-18 11:49 AM] josh#8811
Oooh, I would go all the way in with my fingers, and I would go in and out faster and faster

[03-Jan-18 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I would love that

[03-Jan-18 11:50 AM] josh#8811
I would curve them upwards and rub your g spot

[03-Jan-18 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Mmm that would feel so good

[03-Jan-18 11:51 AM] josh#8811
Good üòö, I would rub it and press it harder and harder as I rub and suck on your clit with my tongue

[03-Jan-18 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
That would be really nice üòä

[03-Jan-18 11:52 AM] josh#8811
I would moan as I taste your juices, and feel how soft and warm your pussy is

[03-Jan-18 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000

Do you think you can finish or do you want to wrap things up?

[03-Jan-18 11:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
We should probably wrap things up. There‚Äôs a high probability that someone will come into my room and that will ruin it

At least it won't explode, yeah

[03-Jan-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
On a positive note, your phone's speed will be better since you have a new battery; the cpu in the old one made itself slow down as the battery aged but it should be performing 100% now

[03-Jan-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I‚Äôm very happy that I have a new, working phone

What do you want to do?

[03-Jan-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I want to first give you a few kisses and get things going so you are excited. Then I‚Äôd work my way from your lips to your collar bone. I‚Äôd take off your shirt and pull down your pants. I‚Äôd trail my kisses down from your collar bone down your chest, stomach, and finally your pelvis until I reached your boxers. Once I reach them, I would quickly pull them down. I‚Äôd tease you a bit by kissing your shaft and the area around it. When you are begging for me to suck your cock, I‚Äôll hastily put it in my mouth. You would tangle your hands in my hair as I go back and forth. I would continue doing this and I‚Äôd swirl my tongue around your tip a few times.

[03-Jan-18 11:01 PM] josh#8811
Mmm, I moaned reading that. I am dying for you to blow me

[03-Jan-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
As soon as you announce that you are about to cum, I‚Äôd pull away and stand up. Even though you would be a little upset, that would be instantly replaced with excitement because I would start to remove my clothing

[03-Jan-18 11:02 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, I'd really like that

[03-Jan-18 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Once I was naked as well, I‚Äôd kiss you a few times and push you onto the bed so you are sitting on the side. I‚Äôd give you a few more kisses as I started to straddle you. Then I would slowly lower myself onto your cock. You‚Äôd put your hands on my butt as our moans fill the room. I‚Äôd increase my pace and throw my head back as you moan out in pleasure. You‚Äôd spank me a few times and make hickies on my chest.

But I love your hugs, I wish I could save them for whenever I felt like having a hug. You just give the best hugs. It‚Äôs so soft and warm and safe and you smell good haha

[03-Jan-18 11:14 PM] josh#8811
Aww! You smell good too hehe, and I really wish I could hug you whenever I felt like it too. I'm really glad I give the best hugs, and I have to say you give the best hugs too! Hugging you calms me down and makes me feel so good

We should hug more often, it‚Äôs so therapeutic. I also want to cuddle with you

[03-Jan-18 11:17 PM] josh#8811
I think we should hug more often, whenever we want. I can't wait to cuddle with you too, I'm sure it's very cozy and relaxing

My mom said no mixed gender sleep overs for now. But let‚Äôs not dwell on it right now, I would love to cuddle with you

[03-Jan-18 11:21 PM] josh#8811
Aww, that sucks. You're right though, we shouldn't dwell on it. I really want to cuddle with you too right now

[03-Jan-18 11:22 PM] josh#8811
I wish we could snuggle up and listen to the rain under a blanket

[03-Jan-18 11:23 PM] josh#8811
What kind of movies do you like?

[03-Jan-18 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty much any kind of movie. But I lean more towards either superhero movies or scary movies

[03-Jan-18 11:24 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, me too! I like watching scary movies with friends though

[03-Jan-18 11:25 PM] josh#8811
I have to see Thor ragnarok still, but I've seen all of the marvel movies

Ooh that one was pretty entertaining

Ooh really? I saw Dr strange in the trailer for it

[03-Jan-18 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I like watching scary movies at my house though because if I am scared I can hide and be annoying if I feel like it

[03-Jan-18 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that was awesome, I love when movies tie together like that

[03-Jan-18 11:26 PM] josh#8811

Because when I saw the visit and the boy, I was so annoying in that theater

[03-Jan-18 11:27 PM] josh#8811
When it comes to watching scary movies, I find I get freaked out a little easily. The last time I saw a scary movie I had to listen to music while watching it and even then I had trouble

[03-Jan-18 11:27 PM] josh#8811
What did you do lol

Yay! I‚Äôm pretty tough when it comes to movies, but there are some things I just cannot handle

[03-Jan-18 11:30 PM] josh#8811
Same here, cause with the movie It I was fine since clowns don't scare me, but my heart literally dropped in some scary scenes of Ouija (the prequel)

[03-Jan-18 11:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I get that. What I can‚Äôt handle are jump scares and gory stuff that‚Äôs over the top. For example, in the visit there was a scene where the grandma was vomiting everywhere. That disgusted me

[03-Jan-18 11:34 PM] josh#8811
Ewww, that's pretty gross. For me, I think jump scares get to me the most, along with some shots that are like jump scares but they just get scarier by fixating on the fear. There was this one scene where the camera has a shot of this demonic spirit shoving its arm in this nine year old girls mouth, and I'm still getting scared thinking about it now. That stuff freaks me out, especially with ghosts and stuff

[03-Jan-18 11:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Aww I‚Äôll hold you if you get scared

[03-Jan-18 11:35 PM] josh#8811
Yay thank you

[03-Jan-18 11:35 PM] josh#8811
It was a few years ago, so I may handle it better but I would really appreciate that hehe

I want to grab your butt cheeks, and give you a big hard slap. I want to spank you harder and harder, making you count each one.

It's because the blue light from your phone is preventing your body from releasing melatonin cause it thinks it's daytime still

[04-Jan-18 11:09 PM] josh#8811
Or, thats part of it

[05-Jan-18 11:36 AM] josh#8811
Right, so I was with James and we grew weed or something, and after we were finished I gave him a bunch of money. And then, I sped away on a dirt bike with a huge bag of weed in my jacket but somehow James also had a bike, and he did that bike trick from the movie xXx where they ride on the water, only he did it on a river and basically sank the bike and walked away. And then I rode away too. I think part of it's because my grandpa jokingly said he was going to grow weed now that it was legal

I can‚Äôt wait for that either. And how rough do you want to be with me? üòâ

[05-Jan-18 10:19 PM] josh#8811
I want to pin you against the floor by your neck and choke you so that you are struggling to breathe. I want to bend you over and slap your ass and leave my handprint on it. I want to pick you up and swing you onto the bed, and force your legs open

[05-Jan-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oooh, yes please daddy üòè

Oooh, tell me how you'd like me to choke you again üòö

[05-Jan-18 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
I want you to use both hands. I want you to be on top of me while I‚Äôm laying on the ground. Then you would start to wrap your hands around my neck, which would probably make me gasp. Then you would start to gently squeeze on it as you leave kisses all over me. And when we start to get more into it and rough, I‚Äôll probably want you to squeeze a little more

[05-Jan-18 10:24 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, I would love to do that to you and I will definitely remember

[05-Jan-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
I'm not sure, I'm sure at first while we kiss I could use one hand in the stairwell and the other to grope you

[05-Jan-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
I could also massage your neck with my hands

It went well. We mostly talked about college. The worst part was the exposure therapy

Yeah it was tough. But I guess I have to do it to get better

[06-Jan-18 10:56 PM] josh#8811
I've never experienced something like that, reacting like that to something I consider normal

[06-Jan-18 10:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, well it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve had to deal with for several years

Gosh, I didn't know it was that serious

[06-Jan-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs kinda strange, because it was so significant to me, I never understood why no one cared about it

I guess just not point it out. But I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at looking normal while walking

I won't point it out, don't worry üòö

[06-Jan-18 11:01 PM] josh#8811
I think you're right, since I didn't notice it (I still haven't though)

[06-Jan-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôve gotten a lot of practice to hide it

[06-Jan-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
The only times I think it‚Äôs noticeable is if I have to start over

[06-Jan-18 11:02 PM] josh#8811
Like, start over with counting?

[06-Jan-18 11:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like if I‚Äôm walking and counting 1,2,3 over and over and I take an incorrect step, I need to walk back and do it again

I promise it‚Äôs completely normal to me, I don‚Äôt care if I look like an idiot in public. Because it‚Äôs like, I feel like I‚Äôm going to die if I step on a crack. I‚Äôd rather look crazy than have a heart attack

I read a short book on ocd that I picked up randomly, called Kissing Doorknobs. It was a story about this teenage girl that slowly got worse and worse with ocd, and I remember they talked about exposure therapy towards the end. It sounds really tough! Doing what your body's screaming at you not to do

[06-Jan-18 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah, I‚Äôve barely started and it was already really hard

[06-Jan-18 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
And my ocd isn‚Äôt even that bad, I can‚Äôt imagine someone with an even worse condition

[06-Jan-18 11:10 PM] josh#8811
That's true, it could be a lot worse

Like if Harper had to go to exposure therapy, it would be waaaay worse for her

[06-Jan-18 11:11 PM] josh#8811
Oh geez, I bet! I imagine she'd have to dig through trash or something

I could not deal with that. Before I had these lights I opened my door and kept the hall or bathroom light on

[07-Jan-18 12:09 AM] josh#8811
Oh wow

[07-Jan-18 12:10 AM] josh#8811
I myself get a little spooked when I'm falling asleep

[07-Jan-18 12:10 AM] josh#8811
I actually sleep with the covers over my head with only a little space for my mouth and face

I had a bad one too but you go first

[07-Jan-18 10:22 AM] josh#8811

Agh nooo you're not here

[07-Jan-18 10:43 AM] josh#8811
I'm just going to write mine out so that I don't forget it

[07-Jan-18 10:48 AM] josh#8811
So I was at school in office hours and I got several messages from Rylee on discord somehow, and I didn't read them until that night. And when I read them it said that I ruined your life and my relationship with you isn't even substantial and is only sexual, and that I'm basically a disgrace. So I respond the next day thanking him for telling his honest opinion and that I'm very sorry that he feels that way. And then he replies but I forgot what he said. Also in the dream I went out to get a soda with Alex and I tried talking and joking with him but he didn't respond as if he suddenly knew about my relationship with you and he didn't approve of it either

[07-Jan-18 10:48 AM] josh#8811
I really want to hear your dream

If people point it out we could act super oblivious like "oh I didn't notice that, what a strange coincidence" or if they ask if we planned it we could be like "nuh uh! No I swear!"

Hehe they'd be so small on me but I'd be willing to try them on for a minute

[07-Jan-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
This must be a long crazy story

[07-Jan-18 09:48 PM] josh#8811
Okay, so my mom got me to join a Jewish summer camp. Already this is a little ironic because of how there's that stereotype with Jews and spending money. So, at the end of the week we got to go on an overnight trip (where we got to sleep under the stars) to point Reyes, a nice quaint little town. And at that town was... a general store. It was absolute heaven for a nine year old like I was, but here's the twist: I spent all my money on candy at the gas station the previous day, and I had not a cent left to spend on the amazing gadgets they had there, like cork guns and stuff. I was so crushed, and after that I rarely spent money on a whim at stores and instead saved it up. I would work at the Charles Dickens fair during Christmas and literally save up hundreds of dollars every year from that, with money from my birthdays and Christmas on top of that. My job, which I got in summer 2016, is giving me like $200 a month (heh I'm trying not to brag about that, I'm working minimum wage lol) and I rarely spend it. I have so much money it's actually more than what my mom put in my car fund she has, by like almost twofold. And I absolutely hate spending it! It's crazy, I just don't like spending money that often unless I'm hungry or with friends. And that's why I'm a miser lol

[07-Jan-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Huh, that is pretty interesting. I hope that happens to me soon because I have like $30 to my name lol

[07-Jan-18 09:51 PM] josh#8811
Aww! The trick is to convince yourself that you'll spend it later. It's what I always tell myself

[07-Jan-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
But it's good cause when I do spend a lot, it doesn't hurt me too much especially since I know I have a stable job to earn it back. I've definitely become a little more lenient with it

[07-Jan-18 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Alright. I‚Äôm also going to get a job at some point soon so that‚Äôll help

I think you would too, but it's not too bad of a problem if you don't need to save up for anything significant

[07-Jan-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know, It‚Äôs just a bad cycle because I want more money so I can buy the things I want to get but as soon as I get the money all it goes to is those things so I don‚Äôt save it

[07-Jan-18 09:58 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, that sounds like something hard to break, especially since going to the mall is a pretty frequent activity

[07-Jan-18 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs not just clothes. I have a ton of nail polish and I cannot tell you how much money I have spent on the sims

[07-Jan-18 09:58 PM] josh#8811
Are there microtransactions in the Sims?

[07-Jan-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
There are expansion packs

[07-Jan-18 09:59 PM] josh#8811
Hehe it would be funny if you had like half a gallon of nail polish

[07-Jan-18 09:59 PM] josh#8811
Oh I see

[07-Jan-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have so many bottles of polish

[07-Jan-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I should count it some day

[07-Jan-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
Ooh that would be interesting

[07-Jan-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I remember I spent over $100 on nail polish in one order oops

[07-Jan-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
Omg!

[07-Jan-18 10:01 PM] josh#8811
Is nail polish expensive? Wow that is a lot of money

[07-Jan-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hey, my family does feed my addiction though. I got 14 bottles for Christmas

[07-Jan-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes the good kinds are

[07-Jan-18 10:01 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow 14 bottles

[07-Jan-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Actually, I think it‚Äôs 18

[07-Jan-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
So yeah, I have a lot

[07-Jan-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
Jeez it sounds like you do haha

[07-Jan-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
I mean, that's not necessarily bad if you have a nice range of nail polish

[07-Jan-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have all sorts of kinds

[07-Jan-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
Hehe you could think of it like a hobby, collecting nail polish

[07-Jan-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
Ooh what kinds?

[07-Jan-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I have gel and regular. The gel is separated into curable and non-curable. They are also regular, color changing, and magnetic. And my regular polishes are all sorts of colors with glitter and holo and all that

[07-Jan-18 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I got an led lamp for christmas with gel so I‚Äôve been loving that. I‚Äôm wearing it right now

[07-Jan-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow

[07-Jan-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
That's so many kinds!

[07-Jan-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yup

[07-Jan-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
What does curable mean?

[07-Jan-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
The polish won‚Äôt dry unless you put it under a special lamp

[07-Jan-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
Ohhh

[07-Jan-18 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
The one thing I don‚Äôt like about gel polish is it absolutely destroys my nails when I have to take it off

[07-Jan-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
Aww shoot, like it scratches them?

[07-Jan-18 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, let‚Äôs take today for example. I put straight acetone on my nails for 15 minutes. That didn‚Äôt do anything. So I had to hack at my nails with a metal cuticle pusher to force the polish off

[07-Jan-18 10:09 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness, that's crazy!

[07-Jan-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, my nails were torn up by the end

[07-Jan-18 10:10 PM] josh#8811
Hmmm, if you use a razor it may be a little less harmful but you'd have to be careful

[07-Jan-18 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
The issue is it doesn‚Äôt matter what I use to take the polish off. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I use a knife or a nail file, it‚Äôs still super damaging

[07-Jan-18 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even when the polish flakes off naturally, my nail is super damaged

[07-Jan-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
Aww shoot, I think you're right about that

[07-Jan-18 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
It really sucks

[07-Jan-18 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
But at least it looks cute while it‚Äôs on

[07-Jan-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
Yeah hehe

You always have nice nails

[07-Jan-18 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thank you! I was trying to not force off my last manicure so it was looking a little crusty. But I did them again today so they look nice

[07-Jan-18 10:14 PM] josh#8811
Yay!

All I did was trim mine today so that they look nice and clean

That‚Äôs nice too. A little trim here and there is good

[07-Jan-18 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000

Yeah. I keep believing that I can maintain long nails but it never works out

[07-Jan-18 10:16 PM] josh#8811
How often do you cut them? I cut mine every other week I think

[07-Jan-18 10:16 PM] josh#8811
Aww haha

[07-Jan-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Every few weeks. It‚Äôs not a huge priority to me because they don‚Äôt grow fast

[07-Jan-18 10:17 PM] josh#8811
That's cool

[07-Jan-18 10:18 PM] josh#8811
I can't let mine get too long since I play the cello and they can get in the way, plus it's not really a norm for boys to have long nails lol

[07-Jan-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh that makes sense. And it is my dream to do a boy‚Äôs nails at some point

[07-Jan-18 10:20 PM] josh#8811
Hehe you want to do mine sometime? I could never be convinced to wear them to school, and I'd most likely drown them in acetone as soon as I was home, but it could be fun! Haha

[07-Jan-18 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would love to! And I have a peel-off base coat so you could take it off as soon as it dries

If you put a milkshake in one yard and you crack open a cold one in another, where would the boys go?

For some reason I thought you didn't get horny when it happens, so I'm surprised that it's like that, and you can't even touch yourself

It‚Äôs kinda funny, I get turned on easier but I don‚Äôt want to touch myself because it grosses me out

Aww that's almost like the universe is teasing you or something, making it like that. And I don't blame you, with all the blood and whatnot; it's probably not something you'd want to get on your hands really

You're really caring and loving. I thought it was so cute when you held your arms out and walked up the stairs, and when you played with your hair during break. I loved our long hug, and talking to you tonight really helped me. I always have this internal cycle of anxiety when we don't talk for a while because I get in the mindset that I'm not good enough to be your boyfriend. I got so bad before I got your messages that I was mentally preparing for a breakup message lol, I'm not even joking. I have a really insecure mindset about it, I don't know why. But, when I talk to you it takes it all away immediately. You are amazing and I love you so much, and I wish I could be even better. I'm so grateful to be with you

Josh honey, I was just busy this evening. Don‚Äôt worry, and you need to tell that little voice in your mind to shut up! You are my everything, and I am saying that with 100% honestly. You light up my world. I love you with all my heart, and I wouldn‚Äôt change you or anything. I love you the way you are, insecurities and everything. Just remember that it is really difficult to get me to leave you alone, so know that I won‚Äôt dip out of nowhere. I care about you so much, and I value all of the time we spend together

I'd force you to get up and bend over

[11-Jan-18 10:58 PM] josh#8811
When I can't hold back anymore, I'd take my cock and slide it inside your pussy while you're still bent over, so I can fuck you and grab your butt and massage your clit too

[11-Jan-18 10:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oooh, I would get even more into it if you grabbed my hips and pulled me into you

So you know that feeling when you are yawning? It‚Äôs like that but in my lower abdomen lol. And it also feels very nice, I can‚Äôt explain that feeling well. But it‚Äôs like my body is yawning without the actual action

I'm going to bend you over and spank you until your butt is beet red from my hands. I'm going to fuck you until you scream

Oh my, I want you to choke me and pin me against the wall so badly. It really turns me on when you do that. I can‚Äôt wait for you to bend me over your lap and spank me really hard. I want you to finish once my butt has your handprints on it. Then I want you to pull down your pants and force yourself all the way inside me

[12-Jan-18 09:28 PM] josh#8811
Oh my god, I moaned out loud reading that last part. I want to pin you to the floor and make you open your legs so I can forcefully slide my long, hard penis all the way inside your tight wet vagina

Hey, this is a little weird to ask but how do you feel about Ivonne parenting you like she did?

[12-Jan-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I think it‚Äôs fine to be silly and tease friends about crushes, but I don‚Äôt like absolute control

[12-Jan-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
I think so too! To be honest, it annoyed me that she tried to ground you. I was considering talking to her about it, but I wanted to know what you thought first

[12-Jan-18 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, she didn‚Äôt want me to go to the bathroom. She did advise me to not abuse the hall pass all the time, which I agree with. But she can‚Äôt tell me what to do

[12-Jan-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
No, she can't. You may have seen how I told her that she couldn't tell me what to do and stuff, and how I was getting cocky, but I was genuinely angry then that she was trying to control you like that. We have no time together outside of school and what she did was reduce our opportunity to build our relationship more

[12-Jan-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, maybe next week we can approach her about it

[12-Jan-18 10:01 PM] josh#8811

Hey, I got some pretty bad news. My mom stormed into my room last night but I didn't notice because I had my headphones on so it was too late to hide my tablet that she didn't know about. She got extremely angry that I had to tablet without permission and she took it and started making all sorts of threats, such as taking away a shitload of money, taking the door off my room, and making me live at my father's house. She started screaming and raising her voice, and I just didn't react to it at all. Then she said that what I did was a form of self harm, and I started chuckling so she asked me if I was still cutting myself. Like, months after she found out she's only asking now, which really just pissed me off. I was tired of her yelling so I stood up laughing and said "Get the fuck out of my room." I took my right palm and I had to push her to move so that I could close my door. I woke up this morning, and she's treating me like nothing happened. I honestly don't know what's going to happen but I'm still going to be home alone, so I'll talk to you later when you can

[13-Jan-18 09:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Josh I am very sad that you had to go through that. I really hope things will get better soon. At least she isn‚Äôt continuing her actions today

Yeah, I did actually. I had to manage a ton of children and I have a headache

[13-Jan-18 10:20 PM] josh#8811
Oh no! Did you drink some water and think about taking some Advil? Maybe sleeping will help

[13-Jan-18 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I drank a lot of water once I got home

[13-Jan-18 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think rest will help the most though

Okay. So there was the whole deal of my back arching and my head tilting back. I let out a moan because I‚Äôm home alone. And it felt like my body was exploding, but in a good way. It lasted a few seconds, but it was longer than usual

Oh darling, I wish I were there to see it, that sounds amazing

I would love to cuddle you, then have sex with you minutes later

Oooh, I'm really hard right now

Hehe that sounds very nice. I want you to get on top of me and strip me down

[14-Jan-18 10:25 PM] josh#8811
I want to force your legs open after I pull all of your clothes off, and I want you to be pinned down by your neck too

[14-Jan-18 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oooh I‚Äôd love that

[14-Jan-18 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
What if I tried to keep my legs closed?

[14-Jan-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
I'd pry them open even more forcefully, and pin you down aggressively

Oh I always love talking to you. I‚Äôm just losing the ability to create long sentences

Do you want to go to bed?

[14-Jan-18 10:32 PM] josh#8811
I just felt a little guilty, because you said you were tired. I could probably go to sleep now if we said goodnight but I also want to fool around more if you do

[14-Jan-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm not really in the mood to fool around right now, I‚Äôm in a more cutesy, sleepy mood. I want to keep talking though

[14-Jan-18 10:35 PM] josh#8811
I could sort of tell, I think it would just be nicer if we just talked

After you had to go this morning, I basically just sat around watching YouTube and occasionally jacking off üòÖ. After that, I biked to Redwood City to meet with my grandparents, and we had lunch. We then drove to Scott's Valley, and I kinda just crashed emotionally. My dad video called me and only talked about stressful stuff, like grades and how I got caught staying up late. I ended up just hanging up on him without saying goodbye, and tried to not think about it by watching more videos

[14-Jan-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well it sounds like most of your day was good. I‚Äôm sorry about the stuff with your dad, it seems like you‚Äôve recovered from it though

[14-Jan-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
It's okay, I'm getting over it yeah

My day was okay

Josh honey, it‚Äôs okay. I know that part was tough, but don‚Äôt let it ruin your whole day. It seems like the first part of your day was nice

[14-Jan-18 10:47 PM] josh#8811
I think I just should have been more active

[14-Jan-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
I'll try not to let it ruin my day, thank you for the reassurance

It‚Äôs also okay to have lazy days every once in a while

Josh I‚Äôd love you just the same if you didn‚Äôt have muscles. You are perfect to me. You are the most amazing person I have ever met. You make me so happy, and I want you to be happy as well. And I am not going to allow you to dwell on little parts of your day that weren‚Äôt great

Thank you for saying all those things, it helped me feel better.

Of course, I meant every word

[14-Jan-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
I guess one part of my day that made me feel happy was that I walked around the house listening to music and singing along as I got ready to go

That sounds very nice üòÑ

[14-Jan-18 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Would you consider yourself a good singer?

[14-Jan-18 10:56 PM] josh#8811
I can sing in tune for sure, cause of my music experience and all that. But, I get nervous if I sing when I know everyone's listening. So sort of? Heh, I don't know

[14-Jan-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd love to hear you sing one day. I know that I can‚Äôt. I can only sing one or two songs without it sounding absolutely horrible üòÇ

Aww, it's okay sweetie

Look, I know what it‚Äôs like to say I don‚Äôt know to every question. I know what it feels like to be upset. I can always hug you on Tuesday. I can give you a virtual hug right now though. Just know that I love you very much and you are my everything. I care about you so much, don‚Äôt ever doubt that. I‚Äôm always here for you, and you will feel better soon. It‚Äôs always darkest before dawn.

And you might not believe what I‚Äôm saying, I never believed anyone back when I was in a rough spot. But take it from someone who had panic attacks weekly and constantly screamed with their parents, it will get better

Thank you, you help me with empathizing and I appreciate knowing you've felt the same

[15-Jan-18 09:39 PM] josh#8811
Aww hey, I'm sure it's something that will go away soon. I really recommend seeing a chiropractor about it since it's happened again. Advil will only do so much if it's periodic üòî

Well I can wear a skirt, jeans, leggings, running shorts, tights + regular shorts

[15-Jan-18 10:38 PM] josh#8811
If you wear a skirt I can have more contact with your love spot, I think that would be nice

Okay, I think I‚Äôll be able to make that work. If it‚Äôs too cold, I‚Äôll wear running shorts

This is a little random, but I just thought about it. What‚Äôs your biggest pet peeve?

[16-Jan-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
hmmm, i gotta think about that

[16-Jan-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
okay, so this has been happening to me for a while

[16-Jan-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah?

[16-Jan-18 10:04 PM] josh#8811
So, lets say that you vent about something that's going on in your life; you say you're upset that this one thing happened. Sometimes, what people do is start talking about something similar that happened to them recently. I'm really okay with that, but I noticed sometimes they just don't even acknowledge how I'm feeling; they just say how they're feeling about something similar. I don't know why, but it kinda gets on my nerves. I'm expressing my frustration and I hope to have just a small bit of support, like one sentence of "aw I'm sorry" before others jump in and talk about something similar and make it about them. Of course, I always acknowldge their frustration even if they don't acknowledge mine, but it still annoys me.

[16-Jan-18 10:04 PM] josh#8811
that's one pet peeve i have

[16-Jan-18 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I completely understand that, I try my best not to do that anyways but I will keep an eye out for that

[16-Jan-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
thanks for understanding; I've never ever noticed you doing it. you're always really supportive when I say i'm upset

[16-Jan-18 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah of course, and I‚Äôm glad I can be supportive towards you

That‚Äôs okay haha

[16-Jan-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
what's a pet peeve you have? i remember you don't like watching other people eat with their mouths open, right?

[16-Jan-18 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs Rylee. I have two major pet peeves, and one of them is a little silly. The first thing is I cannot handle people scraping silverware against plates. It makes me want to break the plate on the ground. The noise is actually painful. The other thing, which is a little silly, is I hate it when people touch me with their feet. There is something about it that absolutely disgusts me. You could have the cleanest feet in the world and I still couldn‚Äôt handle it

[16-Jan-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
hehe, the feet one is pretty silly but i get the instinct around it

[16-Jan-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
i can relate with not liking silverware scraping, but i don't think i hate it as much as you do. is it just with louder scrapes, or even the tiniest ones?

[16-Jan-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty much any sound. Sometimes I have to leave dinner early because it‚Äôs so bad. I especially hate it when someone cuts something and the knife scrapes. It makes my skin crawl

[16-Jan-18 10:14 PM] josh#8811
oh shoot, that sounds really terrible!

[16-Jan-18 10:14 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry honey, it sounds like torture not being able to stand those noises

[16-Jan-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
when we eat together I will do my best to not make any noise with my cutlery

[16-Jan-18 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
When spoons scrape against the side it makes me shudder

goodness, i didn't think you could be in so much pain from that

i only have a slight discomfort when i hear it

[16-Jan-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
It always weirds me out when it doesn‚Äôt bother anyone else, because I‚Äôm so used to getting a strong reaction from it

[16-Jan-18 10:19 PM] josh#8811
jeez, i don't blame you if you feel like the odd one out

[16-Jan-18 10:20 PM] josh#8811
i used to react to a lot of sharp noises like that when i was younger, but it's gotten better as i've aged (haha i sound like an old man)

That there is a type of massage where someone would pull a chunk of your hair and it would crack

[16-Jan-18 10:39 PM] josh#8811

Okay cool. Oh also, while we are talking about necks, I heard a crazy story on the radio this morning

I have to admit, I really like the song

[16-Jan-18 11:25 PM] josh#8811
it's in a 6/4 time signature which gives it a little bit of uniqueness (most songs are 3 or 4 beats per measure)

[16-Jan-18 11:26 PM] josh#8811
i like it too!

[16-Jan-18 11:26 PM] josh#8811

[17-Jan-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
i really liked that one photo where you showed your legs apart with your underwear, and i got so horny when i saw your underwear folding around your love spot in that one photo you sent me. may i see something like a combination of that? i really want to see your legs spread with your underwear on, tight over your vulva if you're comfortable. it just gets me going so much

[17-Jan-18 11:38 PM] josh#8811
I'm finally about to go to sleep, but I thought you'd like it if I sent you a nice message first üòä 
Hannah, I love you so much. You've given me so much love and support, and I am endlessly grateful to have our special relationship. Whenever I see you, all I want to do is wrap you in a big hug and say that I love you. I will always be here to support you. If you need me to come and help you feel better, please don't be afraid to ask. Your health and wellness is my top priority. I am happy to miss class, if it means that I'm supporting you. 
Tomorrow during break, I would love to talk to you about keeping a small journal or logging when you're feeling bad. I feel that it would be very helpful if you had both a system to track your mental health and a way to tell me when you aren't feeling well and you need my support (as well as a way for you to tell me that you need space). I noticed that if I ask how you feel in person, you tell me how you're feeling and you open up. Sometimes I have trouble noticing that you're having a hard time, and (this may sound silly) sometimes I'm afraid to approach you because I'm afraid that you don't want me to. I love you, and I want to make sure that everything I do to try to help you isn't doing anything bad. I would really appreciate it if we talked about things that I can do and refrain from doing to help you through your day the most.

[17-Jan-18 11:41 PM] josh#8811
I hope you're having sweet dreams right now, and I miss you. I love you so much, I'll see you in the morning!

Hannah, I don't know what to do. I love you, but when I see you in person I feel a lot of pain. It's hard for me to look at you and not talk to you or be intimate with you in public. Whenever I think about my broken relationship with your family, I start to get really depressed and anxious. I can't stand having to be on edge all of the time, looking around to see that Spencer and Rylee aren't watching. It started to really effect me this week. I feel like the reason I get that voice in my head, saying that our relationship is fake, is because I don't experience it in public. I'm hurting my own view of us each time I interact with you on front of our friends. I feel ashamed whenever I walk past Rylee, or whenever he sees us talking. I screwed up our potential future together because I didn't give you space when your mother wanted me to, and I have also lost your family's trust and respect on top of it. Sometimes, I day dream about apologizing to your mother and your brother. I know that I will never have a better relationship with them than what I have now. I don't know what to do, Hannah. I started to crack today. I feel like I'm becoming more emotionally unstable. Part of me wants to run away from everyone and be alone, but I can't stop thinking about you. I'm sorry for how I acted today.

You'd get in trouble if you told your mom you were talking to me

I actually had a bit of a dirty dream this morning about going to your house

[19-Jan-18 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oooh really?

[19-Jan-18 10:41 PM] josh#8811
Yeah haha, it was also a little scary though. Do you want to hear it?

[19-Jan-18 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sure

[19-Jan-18 10:46 PM] josh#8811
So, I think we were dirty texting in the dream, and I came to your house. I think part of the dream was with us grinding really close, with our clothes off, but then after that I was outside your house (in your backyard) with my clothes on. Also, the house was totally different. So, for no reason I'm still in the backyard waiting for you to come out, and I just strip down naked (this is set in the morning too). Then, your *mom* wakes up and walks to the kitchen (which I can see through a window), and I somehow climb over a chain link fence to your next door neighbors house (still naked) without her noticing. I swear to god's not real, when I had the dream it was so real to me I was still scared when I woke up. So, I'm lying in the neighbor's side yard naked, and she sees my *leg* because it was extended too far. The dream ends with her staring at my leg and on the edge of investigating more. After that, I woke up at around 6:00 before my alarm, still scared that your mom saw me until I realized it was a dream.

How are you doing?

[20-Jan-18 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty good overall, I have a bit of a headache though. How are you?

[20-Jan-18 11:54 AM] josh#8811
Aw, I'm sorry about your headache. I'm doing so-so. Just kind of mad at my mom because she just sent an email to my boss giving a two weeks notice

[20-Jan-18 11:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why did she do that?

[20-Jan-18 11:55 AM] josh#8811
She said that it's a waste of time and doesn't make enough money, and I told her if she wants me to quit she's going to have to send the email herself because I'm not going to quit something that I don't want to

[20-Jan-18 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh I‚Äôm sorry about that honey

[20-Jan-18 11:57 AM] josh#8811
It's okay, I'm just pretty mad because I really didn't want her to make me quit

[20-Jan-18 01:35 PM] josh#8811
aww!

[20-Jan-18 01:35 PM] josh#8811
because of your thumb, or because you were afraid of something else bad happening?

[20-Jan-18 01:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I was thinking what if it was way worse. And then I had to deal with boiling water

[20-Jan-18 01:36 PM] josh#8811

[20-Jan-18 01:37 PM] josh#8811
boiling water is scary

[20-Jan-18 01:38 PM] josh#8811

Therapy went well. I just finished getting ready for bed so I‚Äôm pretty content

That's good, I'm happy it went well

[20-Jan-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. We went over more coping methods for when I‚Äôm at school

[20-Jan-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
Can I hear about them?

[20-Jan-18 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sure. He loved the fact that I was journaling and encouraged me to continue it. He also said to write a letter to ‚ÄúGerald‚Äù (my ocd) when it gets bad

[20-Jan-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
Aw, hehe you gave it a name

[20-Jan-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I named it Gerald so it‚Äôs more lighthearted and something I could laugh at instead of fear

[20-Jan-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
That's good!

[20-Jan-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Jan-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
Did he suggest what you should do when you feel like stepping out of class?

[20-Jan-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
He said to step out and write out my thoughts. If it gets really bad I can ‚Äúpop a pill,‚Äù as he said it (take hydroxyzine)

[20-Jan-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
Haha, popping pills üòé

[20-Jan-18 09:08 PM] josh#8811
That sounds like a good idea

[20-Jan-18 09:08 PM] josh#8811
The next time you step out, can you tell me so I can try and support you and suggest that idea again?

[20-Jan-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sure, I‚Äôll keep you updated on how I‚Äôm feeling

[20-Jan-18 09:09 PM] josh#8811
Thank you sweetie

[20-Jan-18 09:10 PM] josh#8811
Hey, does it help when you have me with you when you step out cause of Gerald? I could sit next to you when you write out your thoughts, and you could have a hand to squeeze, but you may like distance more too; I just need to know what's best for me to offer in the moment

[20-Jan-18 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah having you there always helps. It always escalates when I‚Äôm alone because I‚Äôm still working on the self-control part of it

[20-Jan-18 09:12 PM] josh#8811
Yay! I'm very happy, and I am more than ready to step outside whenever you need me

[20-Jan-18 09:12 PM] josh#8811

I'll try to help you with your self control too

[20-Jan-18 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the best thing to do is avert my attention

[20-Jan-18 09:13 PM] josh#8811
Talk about other stuff?

[20-Jan-18 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, you can talk about anything else. Just so I stop obsessing as much

[20-Jan-18 09:14 PM] josh#8811
Okay, I'll remember that

[20-Jan-18 09:14 PM] josh#8811

I just wanted to say that I'm sorry; I'm not mad at you, and I care about you too. I wish life wasn't like this and I wish I responded better than I did this morning. I regret how I acted and I wish that I could have done better but I know that saying it doesn't change anything. We're both going through a lot right now and I don't think I processed what was going on well. Please tell me if you need space. I dont want to lose our friendship. I'm still here for you when you need me for support. I'm so sorry, Hannah

huh, that's interesting. i thought you had to take a pill or something

[06-Feb-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
maybe your eyes are reacting to the fluid?

[06-Feb-18 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
No, the tamiflu is a pill I take daily. I used the eye drops to help the itching

ohhh

[06-Feb-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811

I'm sorry you're getting that reaction, are the eye drops helping?

[06-Feb-18 09:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
They are helping a bit. It is a common reaction though

For her knee

Twice

[06-Feb-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
Oh yeah, that's right. Shoot, I'm sorry about that. Urgent care can be a disease harbour

[06-Feb-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
Her knee's okay now?

[06-Feb-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, so she first split it open while running and got stitches, and then she took a chunk out of it while running

[06-Feb-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow, that sounds really painful! I hope it heals well so that she can continue running

[07-Feb-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
That's okay, I think there aren't really many fresh memes right now

[07-Feb-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
At least, I don't think so

It's not too bad, it happened this morning: so I was locking up my bike, and she just runs up to me and starts talking about the snow leopard mascot outside the school which I didn't notice was there. But she acted like it was a huge deal, and even asked me to walk in with her so that she didn't get embarrassed. I didn't really get it cause it's just some person in a suit to me, so maybe she used it to bond with me a little. She talked a lot, and wow she said the f word so many times. Then we walked in and she acted normal and gave the mascot a high five and I thought it was weird cause she didn't seem embarrassed at all

[07-Feb-18 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
She a hoe

Maybe talking and stuff will help, but I find it really hard not to give you affection even through text. It's like holding back an instinct every time we talk

[07-Feb-18 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, restraining from doing anything affectionate feels really unnatural

Heh, I don't really know what to say

Hey, you don't have to apologize; it's not your fault

[09-Feb-18 09:36 PM] josh#8811

I‚Äôm just at a loss of what to do

I am too, goodness I don't know

[09-Feb-18 09:37 PM] josh#8811
It's stressful to try not to get caught when we're romantically involved, but it's heartbreaking when we have to refrain from affection. I want to be close with you so badly

[09-Feb-18 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
All I want is to hug you again, but I can‚Äôt deal with the paranoia that comes with it

[09-Feb-18 09:39 PM] josh#8811
I can't deal with it either, and the insecurities that come with how little we get to be together

[09-Feb-18 09:40 PM] josh#8811
But it's so hard, I don't want to be with anyone else

[09-Feb-18 09:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Aww that is really touching, Josh. The only issue is there isn‚Äôt much I can really do

[09-Feb-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
I know...

[09-Feb-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
shoot

[09-Feb-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811
Can we still be friends? I still want to be friends with you if you want to be friends with me. I just want to talk with you once in a while and see how you're doing, at least

[09-Feb-18 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah of course, we can always talk

[09-Feb-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811

Yeah for sure

[09-Feb-18 09:44 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad we were able to talk about this

[09-Feb-18 09:44 PM] josh#8811
just to clear things up and all that

[09-Feb-18 09:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
The only thing that worries me is the fact that I truly love you. I can‚Äôt be near you for long without feeling the uncontrollable urge to be close to you. I want to be wrapped up in your arms forever. But I can‚Äôt. And it kills me

[09-Feb-18 09:48 PM] josh#8811
I don't know how, but reading that both warmed my heart and broke it. I truly love you as well, I can't not think about you no matter how hard I try. All I want to do when I see you is talk with you and give you a hug and kisses. All I can think about is you, and how you feel. It kills me thinking about moving on, and watching you move on too. I really don't think I can get over you, Hannah

[09-Feb-18 09:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do we wait? There‚Äôs no way I can continue the secret route any longer

[09-Feb-18 09:51 PM] josh#8811
There's no way I can continue it either, I agree. I feel like we could wait it out if we go to the same college, but I'm very scared about whether I'm getting accepted into the ones you are or not. I don't know how you feel about just dating in the open right now, because of how opposed your mom is to it

[09-Feb-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
What colleges did you apply to

[09-Feb-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
I applied to Davis, Santa Cruz, Berkeley (for fun), and Merced and Notre Dame as safeties

[09-Feb-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
I got accepted into Notre Dame but I'm not planning on attending there

[09-Feb-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay I applied to the same UCs except for Merced

[09-Feb-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
that's good

[09-Feb-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
I really want to get into Davis

Oh wow, that's good that you got a scholarship

[09-Feb-18 09:58 PM] josh#8811

[09-Feb-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well if I get into Davis that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going

[09-Feb-18 09:59 PM] josh#8811

I'm really worried about it though because my GPA was a 3.83

Yeah I didn‚Äôt

[09-Feb-18 10:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
What happened to cause it?

[09-Feb-18 10:44 PM] josh#8811
My mom found out I was using a second cell phone to listen to music, and she got extremely angry. Tried to take my bike away, told me she didn't care if I lived on the streets as a drug attic, etc. Just a lot of yelling at me. I snapped and packed up my stuff while she was out of the house, and I biked to nico's house before she came back home

[09-Feb-18 10:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh wow, that‚Äôs crazy

[09-Feb-18 10:44 PM] josh#8811

[09-Feb-18 10:45 PM] josh#8811

[10-Feb-18 12:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like we were such dorks back in sophomore year. We called weed ‚Äúsassy‚Äù so we could talk about it in front of our parents. We‚Äôd be sitting on the couch saying ‚Äúyeah I want to get sassy later‚Äù even though we never had drug experiences in our life üòÇ

It‚Äôs a huge school, it‚Äôs like a college compared to our school lol

Yeah, true

Because of my zoloft

Parties can be loud

[10-Feb-18 12:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah. I can get disassociated when I‚Äôm with one or two people, so I can‚Äôt imagine a full-blown party

[10-Feb-18 12:34 AM] josh#8811
I can't either, I don't think they sound very fun. And I'm sorry you disassociate easily

[10-Feb-18 12:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs gotten a lot better

[10-Feb-18 12:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
But yeah, I prefer one on one stuff over parties

[10-Feb-18 12:36 AM] josh#8811
Me too, I think. The last time I went to a party (which I happened to host), I felt pretty depressed and stressed for the most part. It's better being able to build conversations with people

[10-Feb-18 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah parties can be pretty stressful

[10-Feb-18 12:37 AM] josh#8811
Yeah

[10-Feb-18 12:37 AM] josh#8811
Is okay though

[10-Feb-18 12:37 AM] josh#8811
I'm sure some of them have been fun at some point

[10-Feb-18 11:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
A woman who had a daughter, but she was murdered. To get back at the town she rented 3 billboards and put a message on them, but it caused everyone to go crazy

I am too, I just wasn't sure if you were

[10-Feb-18 11:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just tell me all of your thoughts and feelings

[10-Feb-18 11:54 PM] josh#8811
I'm really torn about us, because I want to be with you really badly. It honestly kills me thinking of us not being together and I really want to try and see if we can get together when we start college. I'm always afraid that you'll start to date other people, and that our relationship would just fade. It's very daunting, and I feel like it's unfair to both of us that we have to go through this torture. I love you, and I don't know what I would do without you. I really don't want anyone else

[10-Feb-18 11:54 PM] josh#8811
But at the same time, being friends and talking regularly does help

[10-Feb-18 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd be willing to start a relationship once we get into college

I guess it'll just be hard for us until college, but I'm sure we can get through it right?

[10-Feb-18 11:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah for sure. We‚Äôve gotten this far, haven‚Äôt we?

Yeah, we have

[10-Feb-18 11:58 PM] josh#8811
Do you want to talk about your feelings too?

[10-Feb-18 11:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
My feelings are ripped into shreds right now, so it‚Äôs kinda hard to piece them together. I know that I love you. I know I want to be in your arms. It‚Äôs just the emotional baggage that comes with it that is hard for me to deal with, you know with my family and all

[11-Feb-18 12:01 AM] josh#8811
I completely understand why you'd feel that way, yeah. I know that I love you too, and I'd give up anything to be with you

[11-Feb-18 12:14 AM] josh#8811
I walked past there and there was a live band, and everyone looked like they were having so much fun singing along and listening to the music. I really want to try that just once, like see a live show for an hour or two. I feel like it could be a fun date if it's not too loud

[11-Feb-18 12:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah I‚Äôve done that before, it‚Äôs quite an experience

[11-Feb-18 09:28 PM] josh#8811
I did some thinking in the shower and I feel like I need to know what's okay for me to say to you or do with you in terms of our relationship; I felt really insecure tonight when we were talking, because I didn't know if I was allowed to send things like kissing emojis or say that I loved you. I want to do everything with you, but I need to know my boundaries so that I don't break them

[11-Feb-18 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000

[11-Feb-18 09:39 PM] josh#8811
If we were able to be together, that would be my perfect world. I would love to go out and see the sights, see live bands play in the city or go out and take hikes. Host get togethers, cook dinner together, everything. Is that what you mean?

Hmm, I can‚Äôt list everything since there‚Äôs so much I want to do. I want days where we go out and days where we stay in and watch movies. I want to walk around the city after dark. I want to go out to dinner with you, and I also want to make dinner with you. I want fall asleep next to you. I want to go on picnics and do cheesy things together.

[11-Feb-18 09:47 PM] josh#8811
Goodness, I want to do all of that with you so badly. I love the idea of snuggling up on the couch watching movies as rain pours outside, and I love the idea of packing a picnic and lying under the sun in each other's arms after we finish eating. I can't even begin to list everything else, you're right

Hey, I wanted to say that I'm sorry for pushing up a meetup onto you, it really wasn't okay for me to do that. I do miss you, but I need to value your mental health more than our relationship. Please let me know if there's anything else I need to stop doing, or anything that I can do to help you. I hope that you're able to relax when you get home, and if you feel like talking later then you can message me

If we were home alone, I would push you against the wall and start kissing you, while wrapping my hands around your neck and choking you. I would start to pant in your ear and let out little groans as I pressed myself against you, eager for more. I'd pick you up and have you wrap your legs around my waist, and I'd grind my crotch against yours while keeping you against the wall. I'd carry you to the bedroom, and lay you on the bed, pulling down your pants

[12-Feb-18 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
What would you do?

[12-Feb-18 10:27 PM] josh#8811
After I'd pull your pants off, I would force  you to get on your hands and knees. I'd grab your butt, and caress it before giving it a hard slap. I'd pull your underwear down, and spread your cheeks to see your now aching love spot. Then, I'd start to spank you harder and harder, stopping every few times to rub your clit and slide my fingers inside you. I'd stick them in my mouth, tasting your wetness. Then, I'd make you turn over and I'd spread your legs open with my hands on your inner thighs...

[12-Feb-18 10:31 PM] josh#8811
By now, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to hold back much anymore, and I'd start to lick your pussy while I side my fingers inside you. After a while, I'd let you help my undress myself all the way, and I would help you take your shirt and bra off. We'd be completely naked, aching for each other. I'd lie you back down, and I'd spread your legs open once more while I climb on top of you, my hard cock throbbing in between my legs. I'd give you a kiss, and I'd slide myself all the way in while wrapping my hands around your neck. We would moan in pleasure, and I would start to thrust myself inside you, in and out, all while choking you and letting out pants and moans

Hannah, I love you so much. You are my everything, my one and only. I don't know what I'd do without you in my life, you mean so much to me. I love fantasizing about dates and our time alone, and I love joking around with you. You are so cute and sweet, you warm my heart whenever I'm with you. Being with you feels so right, it's amazing to me. I've never felt this way towards someone in my entire life, I have that much of a set of strong feelings for you. I want to be with you so badly, even live with you and cook meals, or snuggle up on the couch after a long day. I want to shower with you and share laughs as we clean each other, and I want to cuddle with you in bed as we fall asleep. Goodness Hannah, there's so much that I want to do with you. I love you so much, I want to experience everything with you. I hope you have sweet dreams, honey üòä

I guess he is pretty short then, your friend

[13-Feb-18 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well he also used to be a she

[13-Feb-18 10:29 PM] josh#8811
Oh that makes sense, since biological females are usually shorter

[13-Feb-18 10:29 PM] josh#8811
But that's okay

Yeah, he‚Äôs great. We‚Äôve known each other since 3rd grade I think

[13-Feb-18 10:30 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow, that's a long time!

I don't have FaceTime on my phone since it's an Android, but I'm sure we can figure it out

Ok he says that he is sorry, but he is really busy right now because he has school work due on Friday and will be out of cell service all of next week. Which I know is true because they are doing a no cell phone trip to hawaii for school

[13-Feb-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
That's totally okay, I understand that he's busy. You can tell him that if he wants, he can just snap me whenever he's available and I'll hopefully be there to respond

[13-Feb-18 10:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, cool

[13-Feb-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811

Oh, I also cannot sleep without some sort of background noise

[13-Feb-18 11:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
It must be a genetic thing, because everyone in my house sleeps with a fan on in their room

[13-Feb-18 11:04 PM] josh#8811
Do you like falling asleep to rain?

[13-Feb-18 11:04 PM] josh#8811
Sometimes I put rain noises on my phone and listen to it while falling asleep

[13-Feb-18 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I could fall asleep to anything as long as it‚Äôs not loud

[15-Feb-18 02:53 PM] josh#8811
Does your mom know you're in the lobby

[15-Feb-18 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe so

[15-Feb-18 02:54 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[15-Feb-18 03:13 PM] josh#8811
Weird

[15-Feb-18 03:13 PM] josh#8811
Sorry I didn't see that message

[15-Feb-18 03:13 PM] josh#8811

Well she knows I have it

[15-Feb-18 03:15 PM] josh#8811
I just don't know why Riley would be out both times that I go to get you

[15-Feb-18 03:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
He might not be feeling well

[15-Feb-18 03:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
He also might have an excuse to be in the lounge, I doubt he knows I‚Äôm here

[15-Feb-18 03:16 PM] josh#8811
I think that makes sense, since he wasn't really looking for me during the second time

[15-Feb-18 03:16 PM] josh#8811
Or the first

[15-Feb-18 03:16 PM] Deleted User#0000

I know you can't respond right now for the most part, but I wanted to tell you that everything will be okay. You can talk to Robert this weekend, and he will offer some good advice in return. I'm sorry that you couldn't talk to me much at lunch today, I know that it was really painful for you and it was painful for me too. On the upside, whenever I looked at you and you smiled, it warmed my heart a lot. You are the light of my life, and I could never let go of you. I know that dealing with Spencer is very frustrating right now, and it makes me so angry that you're basically forced to talk to only him. I'm sure that we will find a way to dissolve that situation soon, and that he will most likely be out of your life for the most part in the next few months. I know that we can keep it together if we try, and I will always be here for you. I'm not going anywhere, Hannah. I love you so much, and I can't wait to speak to you tonight. I really want to talk to you and your feelings. I love you, Cutie ‚ù§ üòö

Why are you worried?

[15-Feb-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
Because you looked so sad today

It was strange talking to you in person today, I had so many emotions running through me. Part of me felt really sad, part of my wanted to just grab your hands and kiss you

What did Jessica tell you?

[15-Feb-18 09:15 PM] josh#8811
She told me about how frustrated you are with Spencer and how for a lot of your time with Jesse you had to text him and your mom a lot. I didn't realize how manipulative and controlling he was, it makes me so angry. She also told me you were worried for me cause I was alone

[15-Feb-18 09:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah it just really sucks

[15-Feb-18 09:16 PM] josh#8811

I know you don't, I realize that I think you don't like talking about it much unless it's really bothering you

Every time I get into bed I think about snuggling up next to you

[15-Feb-18 09:24 PM] josh#8811
I wish we could just tell Spencer and your mom to fuck off, that's how I feel. All I want to do is hold you and cuddle you, I spent several hours downloading music for us to listen to and movies for us to watch because all I could think about was our small opportunity to sit together on the way to Oregon. I think I'd go mad if it was taken away from me

The fact that I can‚Äôt be with you makes me feel physically sick

[15-Feb-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
He was upset and acted aloof because I didn‚Äôt sit right next to him in English today

Ugh, what the hell

[15-Feb-18 09:34 PM] josh#8811

[15-Feb-18 09:36 PM] josh#8811
This is so hard

This might sound random but it ties back to your situation

[15-Feb-18 09:41 PM] josh#8811
My mom had child protective services called on her after I ran away to stay at Nico's, and because of that I had to speak alone with a police officer

[15-Feb-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
If you had that opportunity, speaking with a cop alone about your situation, what do you think you would do?

[15-Feb-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I don‚Äôt want to arrest my mom or anything, I just want her to not

[15-Feb-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811
I don't think she would get arrested, but she would have to speak to an officer as well

I'm going to kiss and grab your neck, and start choking you while I kiss your breasts. Then I'll force your legs apart and start kissing my way down your abdomen, until I'm right above your wet pussy. I'll let my saliva drip onto it, and I'll lick you all over your vulva. Then, I'll force you to go on your hands and knees, and I'll grab your ass aggressively, before spanking it harder and harder. My cock will be so hard by then, I'll mount you and start sliding it in and out of your pussy while I choke you from behind. I'll give your ass a couple of slaps too

I think it was overall okay. I'm at my dad's right now so I have more privacy, which is nice. I needed some alone time for a little bit so I could decompress

The school day wasn't fun, but at least the week is over

[16-Feb-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Of course. My feelings about school are mixed, but I have been having a great time since I‚Äôve gotten home because I‚Äôve been binge watching a show on Netflix

[16-Feb-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
What's the show's name? I'm sorry to hear about your mixed feelings but I'm happy that you found a new show to watch

[16-Feb-18 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
School was just boring, that‚Äôs all. But the show is called The Good Place

[16-Feb-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811
Ohhh, the one where everyone's in heaven?

Oh yeah, it‚Äôs funny, suspenseful, and immersive

Oooh, I'd like to start watching it üòä

[16-Feb-18 09:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs entertaining because it‚Äôs about a woman who belongs in ‚Äúthe bad place‚Äù but was sent to heaven on accident

[16-Feb-18 09:46 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, interesting! I bet it's pretty suspenseful, with her having to hide the secret and everything

[16-Feb-18 09:46 PM] josh#8811
I'm close to finishing a TV show, I think I will start watching The Good Place after that

Ooh family guy? I haven't watched that in a while but I blew through like 12 seasons one summer. I've watched stranger things too, I liked it a lot and I've been meaning to watch it again

[16-Feb-18 09:51 PM] josh#8811
You might enjoy The Office, or Parks and Recreation too; they're both "mockumentaries"

Hehe, like what?

[17-Feb-18 12:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
You helped me when I was going through a rough time, not everyone would do that. You are so kind, you ask simple questions like how my day was. And those can be the most significant questions. You are so loving, I know a lot of boys would just have sex with a girl instantly and then leave. You are also patient, because I know this situation has been rough but you have stuck by my side anyway. Most boys would‚Äôve dipped a long time ago

[17-Feb-18 12:04 AM] josh#8811
Reading that makes me feel so happy that I've helped you. I love you so much, and I never viewed you as only someone I wanted to have sex with and leave. I want to be as close with you as I can, because I love you so much. I would never leave you because I love you for who you are and I will never ever find someone else like you. I love asking you about your day too, because I'm genuinely interested and I helped you through a rough time because I saw that you needed it. I love you so much

He didn‚Äôt really tell me what to do, he didn‚Äôt say no though and that‚Äôs what matters. I‚Äôd say the best thing to do is wait it out until college

But yeah, he needs to help solve the Spencer issue before anything else

[17-Feb-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
Is there anything he talked about concerning that?

[17-Feb-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
I feel that's the most important part

[17-Feb-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
He told me that he is intervening next session. Like he is telling my mom that it is weird and should stop

[17-Feb-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
The best part is the fact that I didn‚Äôt tell him to do that

[17-Feb-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
Oh my goodness, that is a good breakthrough. How do you feel about that?

[17-Feb-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Relieved yet nervous. But he said I can put the blame on him, and it was his idea anyways

[17-Feb-18 09:08 PM] josh#8811
Thats good, I'm very happy he took the initiative

[17-Feb-18 09:09 PM] josh#8811
I am nervous too, but he's leading you on a road to a bright future, and him intervening seems to be the first step. I am so happy about it, can you tell me how it goes?

[17-Feb-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah of course. I can‚Äôt wait for this whole ordeal to be over

[17-Feb-18 09:10 PM] josh#8811
I can't wait too, I can tell it's very stressful

I can‚Äôt wait either

[17-Feb-18 09:12 PM] josh#8811
And I especially can't wait for you to have a lot more space from Spencer, like seriously

[17-Feb-18 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah for sure. Robert was actually teasing me about it earlier, he was talking about me finally getting to college and being relieved, and then my mom and Spencer show up to sleep over üòë

Do you like traveling?

[17-Feb-18 09:15 PM] josh#8811
I think it depends on where I'm traveling to

[17-Feb-18 09:15 PM] josh#8811
And who I'm traveling with

[17-Feb-18 09:15 PM] josh#8811
Can I elaborate a little bit?

[17-Feb-18 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sure

[17-Feb-18 09:17 PM] josh#8811
When I travel with my dad and stepmom on vacation, it can be stressful for me because I don't have a stable relationship with them and I have to act a certain way around them. With my mom, traveling is better because our relationship is slightly better (when she's in a good mood). I think if I traveled with you somewhere, like on a road trip or on a plane, I'd enjoy it because we're making fun memories together and trying new things

[17-Feb-18 09:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
That makes sense. I was asking because at Saint Marys, they have this program similar to expeditions where you get to do something different from regular classes for a month. Part of it is traveling literally anywhere you want to. Like from San Francisco to Australia. I find that so cool

[17-Feb-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow, that's really cool! If we both attended, I'd be happy to do that with you (or maybe alone too but it wouldn't be as fun)

[17-Feb-18 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd love to do that with you as well üòä

Aww, yay!

[17-Feb-18 09:21 PM] josh#8811
I did apply to Saint Mary's, and I even got my grade transcript submitted so I'm really hoping I get accepted

[17-Feb-18 09:21 PM] josh#8811
They have an environmental science major there too

It‚Äôs okay honey. I‚Äôd be heartbroken if we went to schools that were very far apart from each other

[17-Feb-18 09:24 PM] josh#8811
I would be too, I don't want to be far away from you. I feel like if you didn't get into Davis and I did (I hope that wouldn't happen), I'd still go to St Mary's

[17-Feb-18 09:25 PM] josh#8811
If we did have to go to different schools, I'd try to visit you as much as I could

[17-Feb-18 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Aww honey, that‚Äôs very sweet of you. I‚Äôd be shocked if that was the case though given how similar our grades are

[17-Feb-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811

Aww, it does sound scary

Okay, I don‚Äôt want to terrify you, but I like the thought of having 3 kids. 2 boys and a girl. The boys names would be Jonathan and Dylan. I‚Äôm torn on girl names though

[17-Feb-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
It's okay, I'm not terrified üòä

[17-Feb-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
I like the names of the boys, they're nice

[17-Feb-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
I don't really think about this kind of stuff often so I don't know any good girl names üòÖ

I used to be dedicated to the name Sophie but I don‚Äôt like it as much anymore

[17-Feb-18 10:55 PM] josh#8811
Sophie sounds nice

[17-Feb-18 10:55 PM] josh#8811
I think what I'd do is this (it's a little silly lol):

[17-Feb-18 10:57 PM] josh#8811
I'd look at the most popular names of the recent years and find a name that's not used as much but is still nice, so that her name is unique in schools and stuff; not too unique though, still a more usual name

[17-Feb-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that makes sense

[17-Feb-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000

I also have to consider the fact that my family has a name trend going. My full name means ‚Äúgrace of god‚Äù and my moms middle name is grace. Eric (my dads name) is rylees middle name

[17-Feb-18 10:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
There‚Äôs a lot to think about lol

[17-Feb-18 11:00 PM] josh#8811
Ooh wow haha

[17-Feb-18 11:00 PM] josh#8811
Do you think that you'd use your mom's name as a middle name?

[17-Feb-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe

[17-Feb-18 11:01 PM] josh#8811
That is a lot to think about, you're right

[17-Feb-18 11:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
So if the child‚Äôs middle name is Megan, what goes with Megan

[17-Feb-18 11:02 PM] josh#8811
Sophie Megan Storms sounds pretty good, I should look up baby names lol

[17-Feb-18 11:03 PM] josh#8811
Her initials would be sms, like a text haha

[17-Feb-18 11:03 PM] josh#8811
Oh hmm, it depends on the last name too, like whether you want to keep your last name or not

[17-Feb-18 11:04 PM] josh#8811
What are your thoughts on that?

[17-Feb-18 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000

[17-Feb-18 11:08 PM] josh#8811

[17-Feb-18 11:10 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, it does

[17-Feb-18 11:10 PM] josh#8811
I think what we'd have to do if we're stuck is go through hundreds of names, put ones we like in a doc, sort out the top ones until we find a good one

[17-Feb-18 11:11 PM] josh#8811
I like the ones we have so far

[17-Feb-18 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs kinda funny how set I am on boy names. Like Jonathan, Dylan, and Daniel are the top choices for me. But I have such a tough time when it comes to girl names

[17-Feb-18 11:12 PM] josh#8811
That's pretty interesting, yeah. Maybe it's because you're picking out girl names and you're a girl?

[17-Feb-18 11:13 PM] josh#8811
For me, I feel like picking out a girl name isn't too hard because I see a lot of good ones, but boy names are harder

[17-Feb-18 11:13 PM] josh#8811
I do like the ones you picked

Oh sounds fun haha. But yeah, every time we come out we get to drive golf carts because my grandma works at a golf course

[19-Feb-18 07:52 PM] josh#8811
That is so awesome, maybe you and Rylee can race each other!

Oh I was wondering how you'd feel about playing music at dinner to mask the sounds of silverware? I remember that you dont like hearing those sounds

[19-Feb-18 08:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd like to do that, but there‚Äôs no way my family would approve

[19-Feb-18 08:11 PM] josh#8811
Aw, I'm sorry about that. Maybe when we have dinner alone we could do that?

Okay üòä

It‚Äôs okay

[19-Feb-18 08:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
But yeah, that would be nice because it‚Äôs actual torture listening to that and watching people bite forks

[19-Feb-18 08:12 PM] josh#8811
I remember how you described it, it made it sound very painful

[19-Feb-18 08:13 PM] josh#8811
I wanted to make sure that you don't have to experience that with me because I know that my silverware makes noise often

[19-Feb-18 08:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wonder if there is a way I could deal with it

Slowly getting more and more sleepy, but I‚Äôm terrified to fall asleep

[19-Feb-18 08:19 PM] josh#8811
Why are you terrified?

[19-Feb-18 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because I don‚Äôt want a repeat of last nights dream

[19-Feb-18 08:20 PM] josh#8811
Shoot honey, that sounded horrible. I can't imagine having that happen to me, and I hope it doesn't repeat too. Do you have repetitive dreams often?

[19-Feb-18 08:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sometimes. The reason why I feel like it might happen again is the fact that I woke up really early this morning, but I fell back asleep and the dream continued

[19-Feb-18 08:22 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness, that's not fun that it continued

[19-Feb-18 08:22 PM] josh#8811
Something that may help is that bad dreams are more likely to happen when you're cold when you sleep

[19-Feb-18 08:22 PM] josh#8811
So if you're warm, then maybe you won't have it happen again?

[19-Feb-18 08:22 PM] josh#8811
Did it wake you up last time?

[19-Feb-18 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
No, rylee got up and dad turned on the room light

[19-Feb-18 08:23 PM] josh#8811
Oh okay, but if you do wake up from it text me and I'll be there to comfort you, even if it's in the middle of the night

What do you think it means?

[19-Feb-18 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
More than just freaking me out for no reason

[19-Feb-18 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
The feeling of not being safe at school

[19-Feb-18 08:25 PM] josh#8811
That sounds accurate

[19-Feb-18 08:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs kinda like what Robert drew from my last grotesque dream

[19-Feb-18 08:26 PM] josh#8811
I feel like this dream is a reflection of your paranoia at school and how you're trapped there

[19-Feb-18 08:26 PM] josh#8811
Yeah?

[19-Feb-18 08:26 PM] josh#8811
You had a different grotesque one? Uh oh, I'm sorry

It‚Äôs just so icky. Why would my mind think that was a good idea to dream about

[19-Feb-18 08:30 PM] josh#8811
I have no idea, it's very strange how the unconscious mind works. I hate it

[19-Feb-18 08:38 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[19-Feb-18 08:39 PM] josh#8811
It was just a dream of me buying a small knife online to harm myself with, and of me opening the package and realizing how I made a mistake ordering it and getting anxious about how I was going to hide the knife. I don't want to harm myself anymore, but my mom kept saying she was worried that I was going to while talking with other people so it made me have that dream I guess

[19-Feb-18 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh dear, that does not seem like a happy dream at all

[19-Feb-18 08:41 PM] josh#8811
It was sad because I woke up not realizing it wasn't real so I still felt depressed and a little anxious

[19-Feb-18 08:41 PM] josh#8811
Yeah ‚òπÔ∏è

[19-Feb-18 08:42 PM] josh#8811

What happened last for you?

[20-Feb-18 10:28 AM] josh#8811
Eleanor just confessed something to Chidi that she didn't realize about herself

[20-Feb-18 10:28 AM] josh#8811
Does that sound familiar?

[20-Feb-18 10:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Are they debating whether Eleanor should stay or not

[20-Feb-18 10:30 AM] josh#8811
That already happened for me, last episode

[20-Feb-18 10:30 AM] Deleted User#0000

What are your thoughts on tahani?

[20-Feb-18 10:34 AM] josh#8811
I don't like her general outwardness but she's otherwise okay

[20-Feb-18 10:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm okay

[20-Feb-18 10:35 AM] josh#8811
How about you?

[20-Feb-18 10:36 AM] josh#8811
Well, I liked her more after I saw her backstory too

[20-Feb-18 10:36 AM] josh#8811
But she's not my favorite

[20-Feb-18 10:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think she was a character who was made for us to hate, but I think she isn‚Äôt 100% perfect. She seems like a good person though, and I like how she is helping Eleanor

[20-Feb-18 10:37 AM] josh#8811
Yeah, I feel that way too. She was negatively portrayed in the first few episodes but then she developed as a person more

[20-Feb-18 10:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah for sure

[20-Feb-18 10:38 AM] josh#8811
Hehe, she always talks about these wacky happenings

[20-Feb-18 10:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
I want Eleanor to date Chidi sooooo badly

I mean, they are soulmates after all

[20-Feb-18 10:42 AM] josh#8811
Yeah true

[20-Feb-18 10:43 AM] josh#8811
I think I may be ahead of you by a couple episodes

[20-Feb-18 10:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why is that

[20-Feb-18 10:43 AM] josh#8811
Because of what you just said, them being soulmates

[20-Feb-18 10:44 AM] josh#8811
I don't want to give anything away

[20-Feb-18 10:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well I know jianyu was a mistake, and they were talking about the whole system being messed up because of that

[20-Feb-18 10:45 AM] josh#8811
Yeah, I know that too

[20-Feb-18 10:45 AM] josh#8811
Oh wait I know a way to tell

[20-Feb-18 10:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
A way to tell what?

[20-Feb-18 10:46 AM] josh#8811
Okay, what's going on with Janet the assistant?

[20-Feb-18 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Can I just tell you where I left off

[20-Feb-18 10:46 AM] josh#8811
Yeah lol that would be way easier

[20-Feb-18 10:46 AM] josh#8811
üòÖ

[20-Feb-18 10:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Janet got married to ‚ÄúJianyu‚Äù and the two of them took Eleanor to the middle place, but Eleanor decided it wasn‚Äôt for her so they went back. Little did she know that she was being timed, and she missed the mark by a few seconds

[20-Feb-18 10:48 AM] josh#8811
Oh shit nope nope nope you're way ahead of me üòÇ

I'm all caught up now, we're on the same episode üòä

[20-Feb-18 11:42 AM] josh#8811
Also the judge acted in parks and recreation as well lol, I think it's because this show started right after the series ended

[20-Feb-18 02:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yay!

[20-Feb-18 02:49 PM] josh#8811

When school starts back up I‚Äôm going to try to talk to him less

I'm happy that you're going to try that

Yup. It freaks me out a bit, especially since he has told me how he feels about her

What do you mean?

[20-Feb-18 08:26 PM] Deleted User#0000

I think I may reach out to him tonight and just ask him how he's doing, to see if he'll leave Everest early. Are you okay with that?

[20-Feb-18 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
What do you mean by leaving early?

[20-Feb-18 08:28 PM] josh#8811
One time I was talking with him last year during expeditions and he said he might leave Everest early to go to a different school

Oh yeah, he was considering it but I think he is staying

I know you have, it's not your fault and that makes me even more angry because  you're trying and it's not working. It just makes me so mad at your mom and spencer

Ugh, what the fuck. I don't even know what happened with that, but if she called the police it must have been pretty screwed up. It makes me so mad, I wish you could report him to the police or something

Alright. Well a while ago I had him over at my house. We were home alone because my family was out shopping or whatever. He wanted to get intimate but I wasn‚Äôt into it, but he kept going, trying to touch me and stuff. I continually kept telling him no and that I didn‚Äôt want to. He whipped it out and came on me and my couch even though I said no and to get dressed

[20-Feb-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
Ugh, what the fuck. That was not okay for him to do that, that is absolutely disgusting of him. I am shocked that he did that, what the fuck.

[20-Feb-18 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know. And guess what? My mom forgave him instantly as soon as he called her. And she had the audacity to ask me why I was stone-faced while she was on the phone

[20-Feb-18 08:46 PM] josh#8811
She doesn't have the right to forgive him when you were the one he harmed

[20-Feb-18 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000

What do you mean multiple times? I know you told me earlier back around Thanksgiving

[20-Feb-18 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like I‚Äôd say no to doing stuff and he would either act sad and ignore me or he would make sure it would happen eventually

Can you elaborate?

[20-Feb-18 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Getting upset if I don‚Äôt give him enough attention, not liking if I talk to certain people

[20-Feb-18 08:58 PM] josh#8811
Did he ever tell you to stay away from me?

That's okay, being muscular seems to be more of a "boy" thing I guess

[20-Feb-18 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with muscles, I just don‚Äôt want them myself

[20-Feb-18 09:16 PM] josh#8811
I get that, it makes sense

[20-Feb-18 09:16 PM] josh#8811
I've always wanted to have some muscles, like enough to look fit

[20-Feb-18 09:16 PM] josh#8811
Nothing like a body builder or anything

As soon as I stepped into the shower I just had this uncontrollable urge to touch myself. I could think about was you touching me and fucking me really hard. I couldn‚Äôt wait any longer and I started to tease myself with one finger. I got desperate though, and instantly pushed two fingers inside of me. It felt so good, my eyes rolled the back of my head. I actually started to get dizzy from it. And I did that the entire time, only stopping to wash my hair

Maybe after college we can just cut off all the people that make us feel painful

So we are in a shady area, just for some context. Like having an RV connected to your house as a living room shady. When my mom and I went to Walmart I saw a woman exchange money for drugs!

[21-Feb-18 07:41 PM] josh#8811
Omg! Did you see what she got?

Because I‚Äôve only been in a Walmart once before so it was like a whole new experience. I walked in a was like ‚Äúwhat is this place?‚Äù My mom and I kept saying that we wished there was a Safeway or a Whole Foods

I wouldn't be either, it doesn't sound healthy

[21-Feb-18 07:52 PM] josh#8811
I'm sure if you do, it will be easy to lose when you return to your normal diet

[21-Feb-18 07:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs like my body is at war or something. Like I had a kiwi and some granola for breakfast, but I ate a ton of junk after that. But there are no other options

Hehehe, that's pretty funny

[21-Feb-18 07:57 PM] josh#8811
I know a pretty good deal about the way food contributes to weight gain, part of my independent study project is about it. Do you want me to link my website that talks about sugar in the diet? You could read it if you want to change your diet for the better

[21-Feb-18 07:58 PM] josh#8811
I'll support any decision you make though üòö

[21-Feb-18 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
My mom already does that stuff with the food we get since she is all into fitness and such. Plus it‚Äôs not personally healthy for me to monitor what I‚Äôm eating that much

We can always run together in college

That‚Äôs true. I just worry about being obsessive about everything

[21-Feb-18 08:01 PM] josh#8811
Running before breakfast burns more fat, so we can always run in the morning or something

[21-Feb-18 08:01 PM] josh#8811
It's okay honey, we don't have to do it often

[21-Feb-18 08:02 PM] josh#8811
You used to obsess about fitness right?

[21-Feb-18 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wouldn‚Äôt call it obsessed, but I did work out a lot and I looked scary

I‚Äôve talked to my psychiatrist about it

Like whenever I look in the mirror all I can see is my chubby parts, and if I do anything to feed into that compulsion things won‚Äôt be good

But it‚Äôs stupid because I‚Äôm not overweight at all

[21-Feb-18 08:07 PM] josh#8811
You're not, you're very skinny honey

[21-Feb-18 08:07 PM] josh#8811
It's funny, that day that you wore the crop top I saw your abdomen and I was in awe

[21-Feb-18 08:07 PM] josh#8811
And just before that you said you were gaining weight

[21-Feb-18 08:08 PM] josh#8811
You'd look beautiful even if you got overweight, I'd still love you

The last time I went to the doctor I was 110 I believe. But I *hated* that, all I could think about was the fact that I gained weight

Hannah, I love you with all of my heart, and nothing will ever change that. I think that you'd look beautiful as well as sexy if you got thiccer too, just as much as you are right now. Please honey, try not to think negative thoughts about your weight gain. I love you so much, and nothing will change how I feel about you. You will always be my Cutie, and I'll always be your daddy üòä.

I'm doing okay, I'm partway through watching the new Thor movie, but I have a toothache because I went to the dentists and they were super rough with my mouth. At least I don't have any cavities though haha

Oh no, I‚Äôm sorry about the toothache honey. Watching movies is fun though

I also tend to have more vivid, memorable dreams so you must not remember all of them. Do you have dreams often?

I don't have memorable dreams very often, but I know I dream

What did you think about the ending?

[22-Feb-18 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
I cried when she opened the note and it told her to find chidi. It gave me so many feelings, like they *need* to be together. And Janet better stay married because their relationship is great. I was totally not expecting that ending of them really being in the bad place either! It totally blew my mind

[22-Feb-18 09:31 PM] josh#8811
Awww, you cried? I didn't cry üòÖ
I was blown away by the twist as well, and I really like Janet's relationship with Jason(?) too. Chidi does need to be with Eleanor, I agree

[22-Feb-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not literally, but it made me very happy. I feel like Janet was great comedic relief

I love you honey, you are my everything. Being with you feels so right, and I am so happy to hear about your cute dreams about us. I feel like we share a very strong connection, and I don't want to be with anyone else. I want to spend my whole life with you, and I want us to experience everything together. I love you so much Hannah, and I can't wait to start my life with you. I can't wait to go on dates, and do the cute things that couples do. I want to make dinner with you, and I want to fall asleep next to you. I want to listen to your worries, and I want to be your shoulder to lean on. I want to be all yours, and I want you to be all mine. I love you soooo much, Hannah. You are perfect for me üòä

Hey, I'm here for you

[23-Feb-18 08:30 PM] josh#8811
What's going on?

[23-Feb-18 08:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Rylee was being a pill

[23-Feb-18 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
He wouldn‚Äôt stop poking me and rubbing his feet on me

[23-Feb-18 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
And he made a scene, which woke up my parents

[23-Feb-18 08:31 PM] josh#8811
Oh no! I know you hate it when people do that, I'm so sorry

[23-Feb-18 08:31 PM] josh#8811

I tried everything to get Rylee to stop, but then he starting mouthing off to my dad

[23-Feb-18 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs because he didn‚Äôt take melatonin and his Ritalin is wearing off

[23-Feb-18 08:32 PM] josh#8811
Oh shoot, so he was pretty hyper huh?

[23-Feb-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yup, plus the stress of leaving here to go home

[23-Feb-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
He doesn‚Äôt do well with anticipation

[23-Feb-18 08:33 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry Hannah, I wish he didn't bug you like that and make such a scene

[23-Feb-18 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000

[24-Feb-18 06:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs kinda funny, one time I fell asleep and had a dream that a spider was crawling up my leg. Then it jumped at my face, which caused me to jump in real life. I also made a very attractive noise as I did so

[24-Feb-18 06:48 PM] josh#8811
did the pilot say anything?

[24-Feb-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
He just said ‚Äúeveryone stay buckled for yours and everyone else‚Äôs safety‚Äù

[24-Feb-18 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because if you were unbuckled you could fly up and forward

aw shoot, that sounds a little frustrating as well as scary

I felt so bad, I had to hold her and tell her stories to distract her

Every time there was a bump she squeezed my hand

[24-Feb-18 06:51 PM] josh#8811
oh wow

[24-Feb-18 06:52 PM] josh#8811
im really sorry to hear that, i think there's a chance she can get a temporary prescription from her doctor the next time you guys travel so that she doesn't get this nervous

[24-Feb-18 06:53 PM] josh#8811
does she feel okay now?

[24-Feb-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000

Aw haha, that would have been fun

They actually wanted to have 4 kids, but Rylee made them decide otherwise

[25-Feb-18 11:07 AM] josh#8811
No way haha

[25-Feb-18 11:08 AM] josh#8811
Did he convince them, or was it that they realized what raising a child is like?

[25-Feb-18 11:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
So I was a perfect baby so they were like let‚Äôs have another. Then Rylee came around and he wouldn‚Äôt eat or sleep, which was very stressful. They didn‚Äôt want another Rylee

[25-Feb-18 11:09 AM] josh#8811

But you are so good! Maybe you want a private tutor or something?

I have a cello teacher that I go to once a week for an hour, and during that time we mostly work on my solos; I've been working on a peice that I enjoy a lot, but I don't pick up the cello to practice it because I also have the orchestra work that I don't like working on. I just want to leave the orchestra and do my own thing, and maybe join another one in college

So, the first day we move in I go into my new room and close the door completely, and sit on my bed on my laptop. I'm browsing the internet and I see a shadow out of the corner of my eye and hear footsteps approaching my door. I hear the knob turn and I look up expecting to see my dad or something, but there's nobody there! The door opened by itself. I took a photo right away, I can show you

I was falling asleep while listening to music, so I couldn't hear anything unless it was very loud. And then there's this loud disturbing thump in my room, such a large thump that I could feel the vibration

[26-Feb-18 12:04 AM] josh#8811
That freaked me out so much! I didn't know what even made the noise

[26-Feb-18 12:05 AM] josh#8811
I woke up the next morning with all my covers pulled off of me, which never ever happens

Ooooh

[26-Feb-18 12:05 AM] josh#8811
And then! That next night!

[26-Feb-18 12:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wow

[26-Feb-18 12:05 AM] josh#8811
The TV turned on by itself when we all sat by it, and the remote was right next to it!

[26-Feb-18 12:06 AM] josh#8811
I swear

[26-Feb-18 12:06 AM] josh#8811
Something was in that house

[26-Feb-18 12:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
It might‚Äôve been an electrical thing, idk

[26-Feb-18 12:07 AM] josh#8811
I guess?

[26-Feb-18 12:07 AM] josh#8811
But I just can't think of an explanation for the other two things

[26-Feb-18 12:07 AM] josh#8811
Three

[26-Feb-18 12:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that‚Äôs strange

[26-Feb-18 12:07 AM] josh#8811
Because I actually thought someone was there behind that door, but everyone was downstairs! I walked down and asked

[26-Feb-18 12:08 AM] josh#8811
And it's not like it was a prank, because those stairs were creaky so there's no way someone opened it and ran back down

[26-Feb-18 12:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that is so weird

[26-Feb-18 12:09 AM] josh#8811
It's funny, cause I don't really believe in God but those experiences really made me question my belief in the supernatural

[26-Feb-18 12:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh I believe in ghosts and spirits

[26-Feb-18 12:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ok ok I need to sleep

[26-Feb-18 12:09 AM] josh#8811
Aw okay

[26-Feb-18 12:09 AM] josh#8811
I think I believe in them too

[26-Feb-18 12:10 AM] josh#8811
Ok we need to say goodnight

[26-Feb-18 12:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Because when we die that cannot be the complete end

[26-Feb-18 12:10 AM] josh#8811
It's hard to think that when we die, that's it

[26-Feb-18 12:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
I believe in reincarnation, like when we die we wake up as a newborn whatever

[26-Feb-18 12:11 AM] josh#8811
But I just don't know if heaven is the answer, you know? It's hard to figure it out

[26-Feb-18 12:11 AM] josh#8811
Ohhh

[26-Feb-18 12:11 AM] josh#8811
You know, there's a lot of stories about children talking about their past lives

[26-Feb-18 12:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah there is legitimate proof of it

[26-Feb-18 12:12 AM] josh#8811
Like kids saying they died in wwii and even showing where they died for people to find airplane wrecks undisturbed

[26-Feb-18 12:12 AM] josh#8811
Yeah

[26-Feb-18 12:12 AM] josh#8811
Goodness, that's spooky isn't it?

[26-Feb-18 12:12 AM] josh#8811
I think that makes sense

[26-Feb-18 12:13 AM] Deleted User#0000

[26-Feb-18 12:13 AM] josh#8811

Okay we gotta say night

[26-Feb-18 12:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôve been obsessed with ghosts since like 6th grade

[26-Feb-18 12:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd go to the library during lunch and look at ghost books

[26-Feb-18 12:14 AM] josh#8811
I used to talk to floating heads when I was like 8 and I still remember what they looked like, like it wasn't even my imagination I swear they were there

[26-Feb-18 12:15 AM] josh#8811
I remember it'd be night time and I'd just walk up to my toy shelf and they'd be there, and I'd be in the dark talking with them

[26-Feb-18 12:15 AM] josh#8811
God that's kinda spooky

[26-Feb-18 12:16 AM] josh#8811
What kind of ghost books did you read? I haven't read much

[26-Feb-18 12:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh I‚Äôve talked to Robert about that since I saw floating heads in my closet when I was in elementary school

Hehe

[26-Feb-18 12:17 AM] josh#8811
What did he say about that?

[26-Feb-18 12:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
He said that imaginary friends are very common and kids have very active imaginations

[26-Feb-18 12:17 AM] josh#8811
I guess that can explain it too, it's just really strange that it seemed so real

[26-Feb-18 12:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have to admit that‚Äôs a strange coincidence though

[26-Feb-18 12:18 AM] josh#8811
Yeah

[26-Feb-18 12:18 AM] josh#8811
I'm kinda scared right now

[26-Feb-18 12:18 AM] josh#8811
I know it's silly but I keep looking around my room

[26-Feb-18 12:19 AM] josh#8811

Yeah I‚Äôd watch them float within my clothes until I fell asleep

[26-Feb-18 12:21 AM] josh#8811
Goodness, I swear I went up to them and had conversations with them

[26-Feb-18 12:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Haha

[26-Feb-18 12:21 AM] josh#8811
I don't think I was afraid of them until I learned about ghosts

[26-Feb-18 12:21 AM] josh#8811
Then I didn't see them anymore by that time

I'm going to be so rough. My cock will slide in and out of your vagina so hard and fast, you'll moan and scream from pleasure. I'll squeeze your neck with my hands, and I'll slap your butt. You'll have red marks all over your butt, and there will be a faint ring around your neck from my hands. Your vagina will be blushed and sore from my long hard cock

[26-Feb-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Alright

[26-Feb-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
So you need to be in front of a mirror to practice, that‚Äôs what helped me

[26-Feb-18 08:49 PM] josh#8811
Ooh okay

[26-Feb-18 08:49 PM] josh#8811
I'm in the bathroom brushing my teeth so I'm ready haha

[26-Feb-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Alright hehe

[26-Feb-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
So practice crossing both of your eyes first to get used to the feeling

[26-Feb-18 08:49 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[26-Feb-18 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000

I'm ready

[26-Feb-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay. The next step is to point all of your focus on your right eye. Don‚Äôt think about your left

[26-Feb-18 08:51 PM] josh#8811
Oof that's gonna be hard but I'll try

[26-Feb-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Filming yourself can help too because you can see what you are doing

Or have a simple conversation at least

[26-Feb-18 09:34 PM] josh#8811
I would too, it's sad because I've gotten used to how we don't ever talk in real life and I feel like when we finally do it won't feel normal for both of us until we spend more time together in person

[26-Feb-18 09:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
It doesn‚Äôt feel right. I feel complete when I am with you. I just want to hold your hand and give you hugs and kisses

I hate it too, it prods the back of my mind very often

[26-Feb-18 09:39 PM] josh#8811
I think the only reason why it's not always 100% on my mind is because my brain's trying to find unconscious ways to cope

[26-Feb-18 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, he was upset that I didn‚Äôt sit right next to him in English. He constantly reports everything I say and do to my mom. He fucking asks me if you are hanging out with me in the teacher lounge when I‚Äôm taking a mental health break!!

[26-Feb-18 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000

I tried my best today to focus on another conversation but he kept intervening

[26-Feb-18 09:49 PM] josh#8811
Maybe if I strike up a conversation with Jessica at lunch, like just casual talk and we can try and include you?

[26-Feb-18 09:49 PM] josh#8811
Goodness, he was?

[26-Feb-18 09:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah he‚Äôd talk about his own stuff but direct it at me so I‚Äôm cut out of the group

ugh, I noticed he does that and I hate it

[26-Feb-18 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I should go to the bathroom and ‚Äúpee‚Äù for half an hour

[26-Feb-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811

[26-Feb-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
But my mom...

He doesn't like Rylee either I don't think

When Rylee was bothered by that Semen dude or whatever, Spencer told you not to harbor him, yeah

You can't love someone and try to separate them from their family at the same time; it's a package deal, isn't it? He didn't understand that

[26-Feb-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000

Okay! Well one, my birthday. I‚Äôve had so many great birthday parties and becoming older is fun. Also no school, duh. I like going swimming or going to the beach, that‚Äôs always fun. Also amusement parks, like great America. I‚Äôve made so many great memories there, like the one time I went into the wave pool and got a hernia. Good times

[27-Feb-18 09:41 PM] josh#8811

[27-Feb-18 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay so I was at great America with dad, rylee, and a friend. We went into the wave pool because why not. I was an idiot and swam all the way out there without any support. The waves were so big that I was swept backwards and flipped over one of those giant donut floaties. I tried swimming against the waves but that caused a lot of stress on my abdomen. I got out because that was scary, and all of a sudden I had an excruciating pain in my lower left side. I couldn‚Äôt stand up. I had to be wheeled over to their emergency room. I laid in the bed for a while until it stopped hurting and I went home. It healed by itself but now my abdomen is uneven

[27-Feb-18 09:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh another great great America story, we went there at the end of middle school and I got a migraine, causing me to throw up on the bus

What's the question?

[28-Feb-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
What side of the bed do you sleep on

[28-Feb-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
Hmmmm

[28-Feb-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811

[28-Feb-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh?

[28-Feb-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
I sleep on my side but I  always wake up either on my left or right, never anything constantly

[28-Feb-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
Oh and...

[28-Feb-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
I sleep facing the right edge at my mom's but I sleep facing the left edge at my dad's

[28-Feb-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
So I really could go either way

[28-Feb-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811

[28-Feb-18 10:09 PM] josh#8811
I could be behind you with my arm wrapped around you, does that sound good?

[28-Feb-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah it does üòä but I was referring to what position you sleep in

[28-Feb-18 10:10 PM] josh#8811

[28-Feb-18 10:10 PM] josh#8811
I was confused

[28-Feb-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
I usually sleep on my side with a pillow in between my legs (so my knees don't press together) or my legs slightly apart, with them slightly bent

[28-Feb-18 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do too! I always sleep with a pillow

[28-Feb-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
In between your legs? I always have one unless I only have one pillow üòÉ

[28-Feb-18 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000

[28-Feb-18 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I sleep on my side but I angle down so I‚Äôm like halfway on my stomach

[28-Feb-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811
I think I do that too, but I'm not 100% sure

[28-Feb-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811
is it so that your arm isn't crushed?

[28-Feb-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811
because I think I do that so that mine isn't crushed

[28-Feb-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000

[28-Feb-18 10:14 PM] josh#8811

[28-Feb-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. Do you think you move a lot in your sleep?

[28-Feb-18 10:14 PM] josh#8811
hmmm

[28-Feb-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
I think I flip sides a few times, but I otherwise stay still

[28-Feb-18 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Alright. I move a bit to change sides and find the right position. As soon as I fall asleep I‚Äôm really still though

[28-Feb-18 10:16 PM] josh#8811
I remember that you told me earlier, I think we'll go together really well sleeping together üòä

[28-Feb-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh I can‚Äôt remember what I‚Äôve told you at this point. I‚Äôm glad we sleep similarly though

I think that's all you told me before, other than sleeping with your lights on your bed on

[01-Mar-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I coated your chapstick in mineral oil and I teased myself with it first. I rubbed it on my lips and slowly brought it downwards, focusing on my nipples. I then lined it up with my entrance and here I am pushing it in and out

[01-Mar-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
Oh my God, you're making me so excited right now

[02-Mar-18 05:08 PM] josh#8811
How old is the kid?

[02-Mar-18 05:08 PM] josh#8811
When you finish babysitting you should report the address to child protective services if you feel like that kid isn't safe, okay?

[02-Mar-18 05:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
He is 12

That means she could have taken them off there, that's weird since she has a kid

Luckily she was home alone during that time. We got home minutes before Ben‚Äôs bus arrived

Alcohol and prescription drugs I believe

[02-Mar-18 05:13 PM] josh#8811
Oh no

[02-Mar-18 05:13 PM] josh#8811
It could be worse, but prescription drugs can lead to heroin

It was eventful but overall good. I got home and made myself a burrito. Then Tamara picked me up

I was there for 3 hours but Tamara had to stay a bit longer

He‚Äôs friends with Jackson, tall, dark hair, sometimes wears glasses

[02-Mar-18 10:34 PM] josh#8811
Oh

[02-Mar-18 10:34 PM] josh#8811
Why is he messaging you?

[02-Mar-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Idk he just said ‚Äúhey‚Äù and the conversation was really strange so I stopped replying

[02-Mar-18 10:35 PM] josh#8811
That's really weird, what do you mean it was strange?

[02-Mar-18 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like awkward, he asked me how my life is but he obviously doesn‚Äôt care. He sent me a ‚Äúyaaa‚Äù so I stopped messaging him

[02-Mar-18 10:36 PM] josh#8811
That's pretty weird, I hope he's not trying to come onto you

[02-Mar-18 10:36 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad you stopped when it got weird

[02-Mar-18 10:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
He sent me while back talking about how he isn‚Äôt into relationships but he is willing to just have sex with me. I stopped talking to him after that, so his message caught me off guard

[02-Mar-18 10:37 PM] josh#8811
What the fuck? Okay, that's not cool

[02-Mar-18 10:38 PM] josh#8811
That's really messed up of him

[02-Mar-18 10:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know, it was so weird

[02-Mar-18 10:39 PM] josh#8811
I don't think you should talk to him again, it sounds like he's trying to use you as a sex object and not actually get to know you

[02-Mar-18 10:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes I got that, that‚Äôs why I started ignoring him

[02-Mar-18 10:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also, completely off topic, Aspen (who is very protective of me) told me to tell you to not touch me without consent or else he will rip your eyes out

[02-Mar-18 10:40 PM] josh#8811
I promise that I will not touch you without consent

[02-Mar-18 10:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thank you honey

Did I do anything nonconsenual today? I need to make sure

[02-Mar-18 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh no, I was just gushing about you and it was just protocol

[02-Mar-18 10:41 PM] josh#8811
Phew! Please tell me to stop right away if I ever do anything that makes you uncomfortable

[02-Mar-18 10:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes of course

[02-Mar-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
Thank you, I have a pretty big fear of going too far without realizing it

[02-Mar-18 10:44 PM] josh#8811
And I wanted to say I'm sorry for explaining what Logan was doing, I know you realized what was happening, so I'm not sure why I explained it to you I think I just do that sometimes. I know the moment passed but I typed it out

[02-Mar-18 10:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Aspen says that you are a good boi

We went to a super small pet store to check out ball pythons and geckos

[02-Mar-18 11:18 PM] josh#8811
I'm really split right now because I like snakes a lot and I've always wanted one, but I really don't want to feed a snake a dead rat...

[02-Mar-18 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah. Snakes are cool but that part can be tough

[02-Mar-18 11:19 PM] josh#8811
Yeah

[02-Mar-18 11:19 PM] josh#8811
I think I may settle for a gecko, that way my little sister can still take care of it when I'm in college

[02-Mar-18 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes geckos seem like pretty easygoing creatures

[02-Mar-18 11:20 PM] josh#8811
Yeah, and they don't eat rodents üòÖ

They do eat these worms though, and they are **nasty**

Eww haha, mealworms right?

[02-Mar-18 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah and super-worms. You feed them with really long tweezers though

[02-Mar-18 11:21 PM] josh#8811
Eww haha

[02-Mar-18 11:22 PM] josh#8811

You could make it a tiny fruit salad

I used to do that with my rat, I'd make it salads sometimes

Aww! Rylee and I did that with our hamsters for a bit

I kept trying to get him to love me but it never worked

[02-Mar-18 11:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
He actually hates people

[02-Mar-18 11:25 PM] josh#8811
Aw he does? Does he bite or something?

[02-Mar-18 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
So he originally lived with my other hamster but he kept trying to kill the poor guy. Phil will come up to the wires and will literally square up. Then he proceeds to box at me and he looks really angry üòÇ

[02-Mar-18 11:26 PM] josh#8811
Omg! Phil sounds like a demon üòÇ

He is! He will get on his back paws and box with his front paws üòÜ

I can‚Äôt hold him because he bites

[02-Mar-18 11:27 PM] josh#8811
Oh jeez!

[02-Mar-18 11:28 PM] josh#8811
Hahaha he should have been called Rocky

Oh yeah?

[02-Mar-18 11:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
How did you deal with your ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù at school today? üòâ

[02-Mar-18 11:32 PM] josh#8811
Ooh okay, do you want me to tell you how it played out?

[02-Mar-18 11:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes please, give me all the details

[02-Mar-18 11:32 PM] josh#8811
I will üòä

[02-Mar-18 11:35 PM] josh#8811
So, originally I just had to pee and I also had a semi, so when I went into a stall and took it out, it felt nice and I noticed the bathroom was empty. I kept thinking about how damp and soft your vulva felt and I started getting really excited, and at that point I just thought "screw it" and started masturbating while standing up. It felt sooo good, because I kept getting hard in apes so I was already worked up. I finished and blew my load into the toilet, and then I finally peed

[02-Mar-18 11:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ooh I‚Äôm glad I got you all worked up ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[02-Mar-18 11:37 PM] josh#8811
It's so easy for you too, I don't know if you noticed but a lot of times I had to readjust myself so that it didn't stick out too much even if I wasn't fully hard

[02-Mar-18 11:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hehe I did notice that

[02-Mar-18 11:38 PM] josh#8811

Did I make you pretty wet?

[02-Mar-18 11:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah, for sure

[02-Mar-18 11:40 PM] josh#8811
I could feel how damp your crotch was the closer I got to it, it turned me on so much

[02-Mar-18 11:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
It was driving me crazy when you were slowly moving your hand up

[02-Mar-18 11:41 PM] josh#8811
I could tell, the expression on your face kept changing and your legs would twitch when I got closer

[02-Mar-18 11:41 PM] josh#8811
I love teasing you like that

[02-Mar-18 11:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I loved it too, I wanted it to last forever

[02-Mar-18 11:42 PM] josh#8811
I didn't want to stop, it was really hard for me to take my hand away

[02-Mar-18 11:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I could tell, you kept moving your hand when you weren‚Äôt touching me

[02-Mar-18 11:43 PM] josh#8811
Hehe I did, I had a really strong urge to keep doing it

[02-Mar-18 11:43 PM] josh#8811
Did it feel good when I was feeling you up?

[02-Mar-18 11:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, it drove me crazy

[02-Mar-18 11:44 PM] josh#8811
I was trying to find your clit but it was hard to find through the clothes üòä

[02-Mar-18 11:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs okay, I definitely would have made a noise if you rubbed it

[02-Mar-18 11:45 PM] josh#8811
Ooh hehe

Oh shoot it's late, am I keeping you up?

Ooh, like what?

[02-Mar-18 11:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I really wanted you to push two of your fingers inside of me. I know we were in class but it was all I could think about

[02-Mar-18 11:50 PM] josh#8811
I thought about sliding my hand down your pants but I was afraid you'd stop me so I didn't try it

[02-Mar-18 11:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would love for you to do that, but it‚Äôs way too risky at school

[02-Mar-18 11:51 PM] josh#8811
I agree, it's good that I didn't do it but I can't wait for us to be alone so I can

[03-Mar-18 12:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm... I‚Äôm thinking that we would probably not stay in one position the entire time. As you obviously know, being on top sounds fun to me

[03-Mar-18 12:03 AM] josh#8811
I don't think we should stay in one position the entire time, I really want you on top of me as well

[03-Mar-18 12:04 AM] josh#8811
But, what position do you want to be penetrated in for the first time?

[03-Mar-18 12:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Probably missionary, because it‚Äôs easy and simple

It‚Äôs pretty interesting, and it was appropriate because the olympics were pretty recent

My hands were shaking so much. It felt like 100 pounds were taken off my shoulders when she agreed

[03-Mar-18 10:09 PM] josh#8811
Can you tell me how the situation played out?

[03-Mar-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
She was talking about having him over and cooking food. I gave her bland responses and she could tell something was up. I decided to tell her the truth and we talked about brainstorming tomorrow. She also said that she wishes he was on the same page as me because this is exhausting

[03-Mar-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
I am so, so happy that you told her how you felt. Thank you very much for telling me what happened and I would very much like to hear how the brainstorming goes

You must be, it sounded very stressful

[03-Mar-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
I can't wait for Spencer to be on the same page as you so that he backs off

I don't blame you, and I'm proud you took that strength you had to make a step towards a better future with your mom and with Spencer (or, without him really)

[03-Mar-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm very happy about it too. This is kinda cheesy but I watched a video about living your best life earlier and it gave me so much motivation and confidence. I mean, I cleaned my room after watching that video, and it takes a lot of motivation to do that

[03-Mar-18 10:18 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow! I'd love to watch that video sometime, I have motivation problems

That‚Äôs what she said lol

[03-Mar-18 10:22 PM] josh#8811
I feel like you already know this, I think the fact she negatively connoted him shows that she wants to move in the same direction as you which means that this will all be over very soon, we just need to give it time

[03-Mar-18 10:23 PM] josh#8811
Lmao haha

I think she thinks similarly, she just feels bad for him

[03-Mar-18 10:23 PM] josh#8811
I can tell she's a little empathetic for him as you mentioned she guilted you earlier

[03-Mar-18 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, see I‚Äôm good at figuring my mom out. She did that because she was expecting me to freak out, but I kept my cool and was honest

I‚Äôm also fixing one problem at a time instead of the entire thing

I was thinking about that, it seems to be safer to try that

[03-Mar-18 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, instead of trying completely kick him out forever instantly, it‚Äôll be hugging first. After hugging, space. Then once space has been achieved we will talk less and less

[03-Mar-18 10:27 PM] josh#8811
It will be a lot less painful for him too, on the other side of things

[03-Mar-18 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah, I will be as respectful as possible towards him

[03-Mar-18 10:29 PM] josh#8811
You are very mature for choosing to be respectful after all the shit he's done, I'm not sure I'd be able to do what you will

One thing that made me upset was the fact that nana said we can‚Äôt just un-invite someone to something. I told her that I only heard of the ‚Äúplans‚Äù two days before from him. Then mom said that they actually planned it for weeks, which shocked me. I told them that I was completely left out of the plans and my family went silent

Because apparently they mentioned it a while ago when he was visiting, but it didn‚Äôt seem like a solid plan. So I dismissed it and was left out of the planning, which could be confusing and/or annoying

I got another spoon of frosting since I got a small square of brownie, and he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why you‚Äôve been gaining weight!‚Äù Even though he knows I‚Äôve been trying to run more

[04-Mar-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
That's really mean, you're underweight

[04-Mar-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
And another spoon isn't going to make a difference

[04-Mar-18 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
It wasn‚Äôt super sugary either, I cut the powered sugar in half

[04-Mar-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
Plus fat production is made from the metabolization of fructose, and dextrose is powdered sugar

[04-Mar-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
So it's not going to make you fat

[04-Mar-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
The reason why it hurt me so much was because I was vulnerable to him earlier in the car when it was just the two of us. I talked to him about how I‚Äôve been gaining weight

[04-Mar-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
You did?

[04-Mar-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[04-Mar-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
Maybe he didn't understand that you felt insecure about it

[04-Mar-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
But he should have

It was brought up because it says ‚Äú103‚Äù on my license, and I told him about how I gained 7 pounds really quickly. I thought it was a sensitive subject and he seemed to understand, but I guess not

[04-Mar-18 09:08 PM] josh#8811
I'm very sorry, I wish I knew what to do

The best thing for you to right now is be compliant and try to not get into long conversations with her. I‚Äôm really sorry that this is happening, just send the email and try to not engage in conversation with her

What could also help you feel better is exercising a little

Maybe I‚Äôm tired and overthinking things

[04-Mar-18 10:35 PM] josh#8811
It's okay, if you were trying to do that for that reason then I understand because I've been there before. I wanted to say I'm sorry again for just being passive aggressive and lashing out, I'm just sad and emotional and when I get like that it's easy for me to get angry at people for no reason

[04-Mar-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just want to make you feel better so badly, I hate seeing you sad. But I know that I cannot control the way the world works and I can‚Äôt change the way you feel directly

[04-Mar-18 10:39 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry honey, sometimes when I get sad it's *very* hard to make me feel better. I have to give myself time to just clear my head and be alone to recover, because I can be a huge pessimist when people try to get me to look on the bright side. Sometimes, you need to understand that no matter how hard you try I won't feel better immediately, and it sucks for both of us

I will let you rest now, I just felt like I needed to tell you that

Ask away haha

[05-Mar-18 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
How often do you have to shave?

[05-Mar-18 08:57 PM] josh#8811
It depends on where... üòÖ

[05-Mar-18 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh my goodness hehe

[05-Mar-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Well, I shave daily everywhere (üòâ) but I can shave every other day with my face and still look okay. Otherwise it gets a little itchy if I stop for a couple days, and for my face I just don't think it looks clean because I can't properly grow facial hair yet

[05-Mar-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
But yeah, I usually shave my face every morning

[05-Mar-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, I see

[05-Mar-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
Do you have to shave often? I don't really know much about shaving leg wise

[05-Mar-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh I can go a long time without shaving my legs because the hairs are so fine, like up to two weeks

Aww that's okay! It's only body hair

[05-Mar-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also I have really sensitive skin so I get rashes and bumps every time I shave

[05-Mar-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000

Yeah, even my armpits get super irritated after I shower. I haven‚Äôt really found a way to get rid of it

[05-Mar-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
Aww they do? Itchy armpits are the worst, I'm sorry honey

[05-Mar-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs not even itchy, it straight up burns sometimes

[05-Mar-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
Ow! Is this only when you shower, or when you shave?

[05-Mar-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
Your skin could be reacting to the soap or the lubricant maybe

[05-Mar-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I shave. And I switch soaps all the time. I will get rashes on my skin even if I don‚Äôt shave/use soap at all

[05-Mar-18 09:09 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness! Is it even worth it to shave at that point? That sounds really bad

[05-Mar-18 09:09 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry that you have such sensitive skin, I haven't experienced much of that before

[05-Mar-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
My mom cursed me with it, and if anything I need to have my armpits shaved so I tough through it

[05-Mar-18 09:11 PM] josh#8811

[05-Mar-18 09:13 PM] josh#8811
Do you rinse with cold water before you get out? I do that and it helps calm my skin down

You know, even though it‚Äôs not bad, you can go to dermatologist and get prescribed retin-a

[05-Mar-18 09:27 PM] josh#8811
Is that a medication for acne?

[05-Mar-18 09:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, rylee uses it

[05-Mar-18 09:28 PM] josh#8811
I'll think about it, I'm really hoping for it to die down with my hormones but if it persists I'll talk with a dermatologist about it

So we were joking around and teasing each other. He was giving me a hard time and being annoying so I asked him ‚Äúdo you want me to take care of you when you are older?‚Äù He obviously said yes and I replied something along the lines of ‚Äúthen stop doing stuff like that‚Äù

[06-Mar-18 02:42 AM] josh#8811
I have to admit, I'm feeling pretty anxious about tomorrow. If we really get to start talking to each other freely, I'm afraid of becoming just like Spencer and taking up too much of your time. Can you tell me if I ever bug you too much? I also value our time that we both spend with our other friends, and I don't want to take up too much of yours like Spencer did. Goodness, I just feel like I have a lot on my mind right now. It's really hard for me to put hope into future happenings, such as your mom letting up, because the way I was raised by my parents caused me to be subjected me into a world of broken promises. Over time, I've learned to expect the worst to happen and it's really hard for me to let my guard down in the moment. I feel like I'm going to need to adjust myself a little bit and be more aware of how I act, now that we can actually probably talk in the open. I just want to say that although I'm feeling this way and it may cause me to act off when I see you at brunch, I still love you very much and I'm not going anywhere. I'm all in with this relationship, and I know that things will work out. I'm very much looking forward to spending more time with you and getting to know you more in person. I'll talk to you soon! I love you Cutie

We're both supposed to hear back midway through March

Unweighted 9-12 is 3.02 and weighted 9-12 is 3.14. UC/CSU is 3.83

[06-Mar-18 09:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know

[06-Mar-18 09:35 PM] josh#8811
I could buy a hotplate and put it on the dorm desk and we could try and fry something with a small pan

Oh yeah, since we have different diets I can find ways to cook meat so that it doesn't make the kitchen all smelly

[06-Mar-18 09:41 PM] josh#8811
I'm not sure where you stand on how meat smells and stuff

[06-Mar-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe open windows?

[06-Mar-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
Yeah

[06-Mar-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811
I can also do stuff like have it steamed with a lid and with vegetables, that's usually not very strong with smell

[06-Mar-18 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
That sounds like a good idea

[06-Mar-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811

Yeah, she was the niece of one of my moms good friends. I ate lunch with her and then we got a bunch of free swag

What was she like?

[07-Mar-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
She wore those big circle glasses and her hair was half up in a bun. She talked a lot about lighting and how she needed to post something on instagram

[07-Mar-18 10:17 PM] josh#8811
Hehe I can already picture her sipping a Starbucks frap with extra whipped cream üòÇ

[08-Mar-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
Oh?

[08-Mar-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I talked to my mom more about Spencer

[08-Mar-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
What did she say?

[08-Mar-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôll give you a bit of context

[08-Mar-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[08-Mar-18 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
So my mom asked why I haven‚Äôt been talking to Spencer this week and I told her I needed space to process things and figure out what to do next. I thought that was reasonable, but her and nana didn‚Äôt think so. Nana said that it baffles her how I‚Äôm so willing to say goodbye to such a good person. Now, that set me off. I told her and mom that he made me very upset on several occasions, and I cried because hormones. I could tell my mom was getting irritated, but I gave her one example that left her speechless

[08-Mar-18 09:29 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow

[08-Mar-18 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
One time Spencer and I were supposed to go out to a fancy dinner. I was in a dress with nice shoes. He came to my house in sweatpants that had a huge hole in the butt. He ignored me the entire walk there, and when we were eating dinner he made me cry. He then told me to stop crying because I was getting attention, and then we left

[08-Mar-18 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
They couldn‚Äôt rationalize themselves out of that one

[08-Mar-18 09:31 PM] josh#8811
Why?

What happened?

[08-Mar-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
This was when I was feeling horrible, and I finally had a really good day. I was telling him about it and how Rylee did something funny. His response was ‚Äú...so?‚Äù I tried to explain myself more and he said something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why you are telling me this.‚Äù Which made me super upset

[08-Mar-18 09:33 PM] josh#8811
Wait what?

[08-Mar-18 09:33 PM] josh#8811
He didn't understand why you shared something from your day with him?

[08-Mar-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. It was absolutely silent and I decided to share a nice story with him

[08-Mar-18 09:34 PM] josh#8811

Oh no

We didn‚Äôt have sex, but are you willing to hear explicit details?

If you feel comfortable telling me

[08-Mar-18 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay I will give you a summary and one specific example

[08-Mar-18 09:36 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[08-Mar-18 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
So overall there was this thing that if I didn‚Äôt do what he wanted he would ignore me. He would slowly force me to do stuff with him and he would try really hard to turn me on so I was willing to do it. This obviously wasn‚Äôt the case though. So he would do stuff like make me get undressed and he would cum on my chest while I just sat there bored out of my mind. He‚Äôd also try to undress me and touch me. For example, I didn‚Äôt want him to touch me but he fingered me until I bled

[08-Mar-18 09:39 PM] josh#8811
Are you fucking kidding me, until you bled? That is unacceptable what the fuck

[08-Mar-18 09:40 PM] josh#8811
Oh my god

[08-Mar-18 09:40 PM] josh#8811

My mother graduated from a nutritionist school; she knows everything there is to know about dieting. I eat organic non gmo foods, and when I have beef it's grass fed (which is the healthiest you can get these days). I eat fruit every day and recently I've been laying off of veggies but that's my fault. I had lots of broccoli and cauliflower tonight though

When it comes to boys, I don't know why but we all seem to be infatuated with bragging about the size of our penises. I have no idea why we do it but I guess it strokes our ego lol

Our ‚Äúdates‚Äù were laying on the couch for 5 hours doing nothing. Every once in a while I‚Äôd convince him to get pizza. And yes he always ran the conversation. One time I forced him to come to this indo-Asian restaurant and he got fries from the kids meal section üòÖ

When you mean fried chicken, do you know where he eats it from?

[08-Mar-18 10:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
What are your thoughts on it?

[08-Mar-18 10:23 PM] josh#8811
I think it's okay to share what you like, but if you're constantly buying albums and stuff for the s/o and it's obvious that they're not really interested then you shouldn't really do that

[08-Mar-18 10:23 PM] josh#8811
I know I kind of screwed up when I got you that Abbey Road album but I didn't really know what I was doing

But yeah he always played the music he likes in the car and whenever we shared headphones. And when I suggested something he always made some snarky comment about it

[08-Mar-18 10:25 PM] josh#8811
Aw that's mean! He should have respected what you like listening to

[08-Mar-18 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
It would be passive aggressive, like ‚Äúwow you always listen to this!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI knew you would choose this song!‚Äù

Ouch, that's pretty mean how he did that

And yeah the Beatles are good and were lovely artists, but I like variety

[08-Mar-18 10:27 PM] josh#8811
Lol I bet he listens to the anthology albums like they're some sort of art experience

[08-Mar-18 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000

[08-Mar-18 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
We saw la la land together when it first came out. He got really mad at me because when he asked what I thought about it, I said it was good. And apparently ‚Äúgood‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enough to express the true art and beauty of the film

[08-Mar-18 10:30 PM] josh#8811
Lmao are you kidding me, it's not like La La Land was actually a work of art!

[08-Mar-18 10:30 PM] josh#8811
He's so full of it

[08-Mar-18 10:30 PM] josh#8811
That short film that he made with Reed some months ago was pretty bad, I have to admit

And yeah, the short film was trash

[08-Mar-18 10:32 PM] josh#8811
Reed was playing as this poor musician guy that used spoons and glasses with water to make music? But the color grading was really bad and it was really unrealistic

[08-Mar-18 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah I kinda remember it. I wasn‚Äôt completely paying attention to it though

[08-Mar-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
Yeah

[08-Mar-18 10:34 PM] josh#8811
At first, I tried my best to analyze some stuff I noticed cause I thought he put it in there on purpose to express stuff, but it turns out a lot of it had no meaning

I dunno

[08-Mar-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000

[08-Mar-18 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[08-Mar-18 10:35 PM] josh#8811
Yeah so he said the meaning was that you can be poor and still make good music, but a lot of it didn't make sense

[08-Mar-18 10:36 PM] josh#8811
They used fancy glasses and some were completely behind Reed where he couldn't reach them

[08-Mar-18 10:36 PM] josh#8811
And at the end he sighed and drank out of a cracked one, and I thought it had a meaning like "accept your own faulty characteristics" but it had no meaning

[08-Mar-18 10:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm yeah it doesn‚Äôt seem to make much sense

[08-Mar-18 10:37 PM] josh#8811

[08-Mar-18 10:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[08-Mar-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt take care of his teeth

[08-Mar-18 10:49 PM] josh#8811
I wonder how often he brushes

[08-Mar-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well his orthodontist said that he has to brush more often

Oh wow

He's going to lose those teeth if he doesn't take care of them

Yeah, the only sexual thing he wanted to do was cum on my chest. If I tried to do anything else he either laughed or didn‚Äôt like it at all

[08-Mar-18 11:03 PM] josh#8811
That's really repetitive of him, and I'm sad that you didn't get to explore yourself but also happy that we have each other now

I got a little turned on when we were doing that and playing footsie, it's funny how little contact I need from you for me to feel so strongly

[08-Mar-18 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I loved playing footsie with you, it sent little shocks of electricity through my body. I also loved how you continually scooted closer and closer to me

[08-Mar-18 11:10 PM] josh#8811
Awww! I couldn't help but move closer, and playing footsie gave me little shocks too

Ooh that‚Äôs right

And of course I did because of my cello experience but I was still so proud and I was basically laughing really hard in my head

Cause he thinks he's so artsy that he owns a bass and a guitar

[08-Mar-18 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
He just wasn‚Äôt impressed. Like I was laughing and having fun, with Meredith of all people! And Spencer didn‚Äôt find it funny, I just had to draw them and get it done in his eyes

It‚Äôs a defense mechanism that basically means you do the opposite of how you really feel. He resents you, so he wants to hang out with you more

Oh yeah that‚Äôs another thing

[08-Mar-18 11:38 PM] josh#8811
That's rude!

[08-Mar-18 11:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
He prioritized his friends over me too

[08-Mar-18 11:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
And like I get having a balance and everything, but this was plain rude

[08-Mar-18 11:39 PM] josh#8811
That makes me feel a little sick, imagining him just at your house and only on his phone

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
That was my life

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] josh#8811
That was really rude of him

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] josh#8811
Ugh

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
There was one time where he hung up on me because his friend was calling him

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] josh#8811
What, really?

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Instead of a waiting a few minutes to say goodbye

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[08-Mar-18 11:40 PM] josh#8811
He couldn't call him back? ...

[08-Mar-18 11:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
I couldn‚Äôt tell you

[08-Mar-18 11:41 PM] josh#8811
He probably could have

[08-Mar-18 11:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
There was another time where he sent me home because his friend was FaceTiming him

[08-Mar-18 11:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
He wouldn‚Äôt let me say hi to him or anything

[08-Mar-18 11:41 PM] josh#8811
Wha- what? What?!

[08-Mar-18 11:41 PM] josh#8811
Lmao okay

That's just mean

[08-Mar-18 11:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah it was strange

[08-Mar-18 11:42 PM] josh#8811
I feel like he didn't view you as a partner as much as a sex object or something

[08-Mar-18 11:42 PM] josh#8811
Not really even as a friend

[08-Mar-18 11:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt know what I was to him

[08-Mar-18 11:42 PM] josh#8811

[09-Mar-18 08:39 PM] josh#8811
Ah I see

[09-Mar-18 08:39 PM] josh#8811
If I don't get accepted, I may attend another college for two years and then transfer

[09-Mar-18 08:40 PM] josh#8811
I think it depends on what happens, you know?

[09-Mar-18 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I‚Äôm going to transfer at some point because st Mary‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have forensics

[09-Mar-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
That's neat, I don't know what I'll do at this point but I'd like to do that as well, as transferring to Davis from a college was what my mom suggested in soph year

[09-Mar-18 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôve talked about it a lot with several people. Not as many people apply for masters and above so I‚Äôll have a better chance

[09-Mar-18 08:46 PM] josh#8811
I've talked with people too, it seems like you only need to do pretty well and you have a good chance

What job do you want to have?

[09-Mar-18 08:48 PM] josh#8811
I want to be in the environmental field, and I was thinking about being a hydrologist since water is going to be more important as the population rises. I honestly don't know what I want to do completely, I feel like I'm okay with just going where life takes me after I get my degree

[09-Mar-18 08:49 PM] josh#8811

It‚Äôs not like I want to live extravagantly anyway

[09-Mar-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811
Same here, I think I'd be satisfied if we could afford everything we needed and be able to eat healthy food and stuff, you know? Being wealthy would also be nice

Oh yeah me too, that seems too much

[09-Mar-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811

I‚Äôm not sure, it depends on where the job offerings are. I don‚Äôt want to drop everything and move to Los Angeles, but I‚Äôd like to have some space from my family

[09-Mar-18 08:57 PM] josh#8811

What are your thoughts on long distance relationships, if that had to happen? I'd still be in Belmont going to Notre Dame

[09-Mar-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know they can work if the two people really love each other. The woman I used to babysit for had a long distance relationship with her husband when they were in college, and they were further apart than you and I will probably be. They were high school sweethearts and got married right after college

[09-Mar-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow, that's a heartwarming story

[09-Mar-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
If you want to try it, I would want to have a long distance relationship with you. I mean, we could still visit each other and stuff but I don't know if you're open to that

[09-Mar-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Of course honey, if we are still happy together I will do anything to keep our relationship strong

[09-Mar-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811

I feel the same way, if we're still happy together I want to make it work if we don't go to the same schools

Ooh, that's right

[09-Mar-18 09:29 PM] josh#8811
I think you were! Initiating it helps show your mom that you were really affected and it's a big enough issue to confront directly

Totally. I also go right for the neck and I know how to make her speechless, so that helps

Did she disregard each one? I feel like she did

Like it‚Äôs just because we are close

[09-Mar-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
I don't think she can tell you how you should feel and define how you're feeling when you're already telling her

[09-Mar-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
I wonder why she does that

[09-Mar-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
That's pretty weird

[09-Mar-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
And it's mean, too

My family is really weird when it comes to the way they view me

[09-Mar-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
It really sounds like it

[09-Mar-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
They tell you everything like they know it and you don't

It's funny, my mom seems to be more like the opposite when it comes to sexuality and stuff

[09-Mar-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
She's asked me if I'm gay a *lot*

[09-Mar-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811

When she drove James and I home one time, she asked us if we were *gay together* like what the heck

Oh my god

[09-Mar-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811
one time I got a weird thing in the back of my throat and she was convinced that I got it from James as an STD, even after the docter told her it wasn't

[09-Mar-18 10:14 PM] josh#8811
Because we liked to hike together

[10-Mar-18 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just bit a pad, put one leg on the counter, and pulled

But I‚Äôm at the end

[10-Mar-18 10:32 PM] josh#8811
Ah I see, that does make sense cause more lubrication right?

[10-Mar-18 10:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[10-Mar-18 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Talking about lube, I had to pour an entire bottle in my vagina to get it out lol

[10-Mar-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
omg are you kidding me?

[10-Mar-18 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Mar-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
Ah I see haha

[10-Mar-18 10:34 PM] josh#8811
Do you think you're going to try and use a tampon again the next time you have a period?

[10-Mar-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah because once it‚Äôs in it‚Äôs so easy

[10-Mar-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
It doesn‚Äôt feel as gross

[10-Mar-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000

Were you afraid it would get stuck in there or something?

[10-Mar-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
It just hurt

[10-Mar-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
It was in there good

[10-Mar-18 10:36 PM] josh#8811
When did it hurt?

[10-Mar-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I tried pulling it out slowly

[10-Mar-18 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
The trick is you have to pull it as hard as you can

[10-Mar-18 10:37 PM] josh#8811
Oof, that sounds scary

[10-Mar-18 10:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, that was the first time I had to do it

[10-Mar-18 10:37 PM] josh#8811
Man

[10-Mar-18 10:38 PM] josh#8811
I'm happy that you tried it though

[10-Mar-18 10:38 PM] Deleted User#0000

Omg I forgot to tell you, Alex is really onto us! So, on Friday after school got out, I used the bathroom and walked out to my bike. Alex was there and he said "look who it is!" He asked me where I went, and he was really suggestive. I got all flustered cause I knew he thought I was with you, and I tried telling him that I was using the bathroom and he could see my damp hands as proof but then he made sexual innuendo out of it! And he brought it up right away, he must have been talking with James and Maja about us before I had arrived. He's so silly lol üòÇ

[11-Mar-18 03:15 AM] josh#8811
I hope you are having sweet dreams, and I miss you very much. I love you!

[11-Mar-18 08:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
So I had Harper in the bathroom with me telling me how to use a tampon üòÇ

[11-Mar-18 08:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I tried everything to get that thing in there, but the angle was wrong

[11-Mar-18 08:30 PM] josh#8811
Oh my goodness lol üòÖ

[11-Mar-18 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
So I got naked in the tub and pushed it in. I got really excited and told her ‚Äúit‚Äôs going in!‚Äù But I started laughing and it came back out

[11-Mar-18 08:31 PM] josh#8811
Hehehe omg Hannah üòÇ

[11-Mar-18 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
I eventually got it in but the stress was too much I guess so I got super pale and panicky

[11-Mar-18 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
But once it was in I had absolutely no issues!

[11-Mar-18 08:32 PM] josh#8811
That's great! I'm sorry you got panicky but it sounds like it otherwise went really well

[11-Mar-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I had to get closer to my vagina than ever before üòÇ

[11-Mar-18 08:33 PM] josh#8811
And hey, if you even need my help or support I'll be there lol

[11-Mar-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because when I was getting it out, I had to put two fingers in there to pull it out enough to yank the string

[11-Mar-18 08:34 PM] josh#8811
Oh man haha, I thought the string would be long enough to hang out üòù

[11-Mar-18 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well yeah, but it was dry and way up there

[11-Mar-18 08:34 PM] josh#8811
Ah I see

[11-Mar-18 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
It hurt when I pulled it, I had to bite on something

[11-Mar-18 08:35 PM] josh#8811
Aw oh no! I remember, you said you had to bite on a pad ‚òπÔ∏è

[11-Mar-18 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
The only reason I got it out by myself was because my aunt told me a funny story

[11-Mar-18 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it was because I was so tense

[11-Mar-18 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would do it again though

[11-Mar-18 08:36 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad she was there to help you, can you tell me how it goes the next time you try it?

[11-Mar-18 08:36 PM] Deleted User#0000

Lol I bet, it sounds the opposite of sexually pleasing

[11-Mar-18 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs also the furthest anything‚Äôs been up my vagina, so that‚Äôs cool

[11-Mar-18 08:38 PM] josh#8811
How did that feel?

[11-Mar-18 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn‚Äôt feel anything, which was supposed to happen

[11-Mar-18 08:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it was almost to my cervix

[11-Mar-18 08:39 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow, that's pretty deep

[11-Mar-18 08:39 PM] josh#8811
I know the cervix moves down when you're on your period, but still wow

[11-Mar-18 08:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah the applicator was as long as my middle finger I think

[11-Mar-18 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
And then I had to push the actual thing up into it

[11-Mar-18 08:40 PM] josh#8811
Woah

[11-Mar-18 08:40 PM] josh#8811

Okay

[12-Mar-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
I'm okay trying things that you're sure you'd enjoy, if that's what you want me to do. It can be hard for me to hit or slap people in general because I'm afraid it's causing them pain, but if you're curious we can walk through it so that I get used to that idea, if that's what you'd like. I only want to make you feel good, honey

[12-Mar-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, we can try it out. I think it‚Äôs mostly the thought of not being in control that draws me to it. Plus I get so much enjoyment out of spanking, so maybe other places will feel similar

[12-Mar-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
That's true, and thank you for telling me. What would you like to try out?

[12-Mar-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I think we should ease into it at first. For example, thighs or arms

[12-Mar-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
I think that's a good idea too

[12-Mar-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811

I'll probably be pretty gentle at first, so if you want me to be harder you can tell me in the moment or afterwards. Same with if I'm being too hard as well

Tell me more üòã

[12-Mar-18 09:19 PM] josh#8811
I've thought about punishing you, like pinning you against the wall by your neck and choking you before letting up a little and slapping your face with my hand

[12-Mar-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
I haven't thought about it very often because I didn't know how you felt about it, but it excites me

[12-Mar-18 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd love that

[12-Mar-18 09:21 PM] josh#8811
Yay!

Is there anything else that you'd like me to do?

[12-Mar-18 09:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm

[12-Mar-18 09:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Slapping/spanking, choking, and hickeys are the things I enjoy. Basically anything that makes you in complete control

[12-Mar-18 09:24 PM] josh#8811
I love being in control so much, thinking about this is making me pretty horny

[12-Mar-18 09:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ooh I‚Äôm glad you enjoy it

[12-Mar-18 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do you have anything in mind?

[12-Mar-18 09:25 PM] josh#8811
Hmmm

[12-Mar-18 09:27 PM] josh#8811
I'm curious as to what you mean by saying you love being hit, I already enjoy the idea of everything we've mentioned and I wanted to know if you've thought about anything else relating to that. It's hard for me to find anything else in mind that hasn't been suggested, I love pinning you down though. I'm touching myself thinking about dominating you like that

[12-Mar-18 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know we have talked about it before and I know it will be much easier soon, but I love the thought of rules and punishment

[12-Mar-18 09:29 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, yeah?

[12-Mar-18 09:29 PM] josh#8811
I was thinking about bringing that up again but I forgot to now

[12-Mar-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
Would you like me to give you those punishments we pinned?

I'm going to pin you down, and I'm going to choke you so much. You won't be able to resist, you'll be powerless. Then I'm going to force you on your hands and knees so I can slap your butt with my hand until it's red all over, before I slide my cock inside you

Yeah?

[14-Mar-18 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Spencer told my mom that I was ‚Äúmean‚Äù to him because when he was looking at me I said ‚Äúcan I help you?‚Äù And apparently he was really upset about it. The thing is, I do that with dad and Rylee all the time so I am used to that behavior

[14-Mar-18 10:09 PM] josh#8811
God, what an asshole omg I'm sorry üòÇ

Robert and I refer to Spencer as ‚Äúmy cousin,‚Äù and when my mom told me that, I said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the most annoying cousin I‚Äôve ever had‚Äù

Omg haha, that's funny üòÇ

Did she get it?

Yeah Robert explained it to her. We refer to him as a cousin because we hang out occasionally but there isn‚Äôt much connection

[14-Mar-18 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
So I cousin-zoned him

[14-Mar-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811

Yay

[14-Mar-18 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
The reason why I can‚Äôt stand those words is because of the connotation and meaning behind them. For me, it means that something is wrong with me or different in a bad way. My family used it as an insult back when I was in a bad spot. That my ‚Äúold‚Äù version was way better than who I am now. I hate that so much because back then I bit my tongue and didn‚Äôt speak up if something was annoying me. I was a coward and I was too self-conscious to do anything to help myself

[14-Mar-18 10:25 PM] josh#8811
Thank you for telling me how you feel about those words, and I completely understand how you feel that way. I'm really angry that your family would use your insecurities against you like that and tell you how you used to be a better person

[14-Mar-18 10:42 PM] josh#8811
It's important for us to talk about stuff like this, and it brings us closer together too üòä

[14-Mar-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
And hey, if I ever sit too close to you or do anything you don't want me to, I'll stop right away if you let me know

Want to know something really stupid, like this delusion I had?

[14-Mar-18 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sure

[14-Mar-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
So it was around a week before Valentine's Day, and I was walking around Everest putting up girl scout cookie ads during plt, and I swear when I was upstairs approaching the back stairwell my brain convinced me that you were there, in the spot with Spencer. And I had no idea what to do, because I was absolutely sure you guys were there, even though I had no reason to think that. I ended up putting my poster right at the top of the stairwell without looking behind me, but when I turned around I saw it was empty and felt this huge relief, before a wave of depression

For me it's just second nature, I don't want to grab them and potentially hurt you

[14-Mar-18 10:56 PM] josh#8811
I don't think Spencer is good at understanding how other people feel

[15-Mar-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the reason why I‚Äôm pushed to an orgasm so quickly is the fact that I‚Äôm using your chapstick

Okay I‚Äôll guide you through it. I don‚Äôt immediately start, I wait to get pretty excited and wet first. And I unconsciously start rubbing myself outside my pants. When I can‚Äôt take anymore, I grab your chapstick üòâ. I tease myself with it a bit, I‚Äôll put some on my lips and I‚Äôll rub myself with it. Then I start actually pushing it inside me, occasionally rubbing my clitoris with it as well

Harper had to deal with that on her way back from Pismo beach, and they had to stop constantly

[16-Mar-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that

[16-Mar-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
It sounds really uncomfortable

[16-Mar-18 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
And imagine needing to go to the bathroom at school and you need to wait for some idiot to come back after a 20 minute trip

[16-Mar-18 09:31 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness that happens?

[16-Mar-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, and it feels like life or death. Because if I wait too long, I‚Äôm afraid of bleeding through my pants and leaving a stain

[16-Mar-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
It happens

[16-Mar-18 09:32 PM] josh#8811
Oh no! Have you ever told the teacher that it can't wait?

[16-Mar-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs easier with female teachers, but I can say that it‚Äôs an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù and I can go usually

[16-Mar-18 09:33 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad you can, that's a bit of a relief but I'm sorry it has to be like that

[16-Mar-18 09:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just wish people were more open about it

[16-Mar-18 09:35 PM] josh#8811
I wish they were too, I've grown up seeing it as a really private thing but talking to you makes it seem *normal*

[16-Mar-18 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs weird, it is just as normal as needing to eat or go to the bathroom

[16-Mar-18 09:35 PM] josh#8811

I remember you were in pain when you got off of your birth control

Is it more painful, or is it more that you bleed more?

Because even though it is uncomfortable at first, spreading out will get rid of cramps

[16-Mar-18 09:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
So the best thing to do is lie on my back

[16-Mar-18 09:48 PM] josh#8811

What do you wash your face with?

[16-Mar-18 09:59 PM] josh#8811
I use a face wash from trader Joe's. First I rinse my face in warm water, then I wet a wash cloth and put the face wash on it. After that, I scrub my face and my back, then rinse with cold water before stepping out and sometimes putting a very light layer of coconut oil on dry spots

[16-Mar-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
What kind of face wash?

[16-Mar-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
I have no idea üò¨

[16-Mar-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Does it have salicylic acid in it?

[16-Mar-18 10:01 PM] josh#8811
I think it's exfoliating? It's a natural wash, I have no idea if it has acid

[16-Mar-18 10:01 PM] josh#8811
I'd check right now but I'm at my dad's

[16-Mar-18 10:01 PM] josh#8811
I'll remind myself to check when I get back

[16-Mar-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd say make sure it has that stuff in it, as it is specifically used for acne treatment. Also, I‚Äôd recommend a charcoal face wash, I use it and it is wonderful

[16-Mar-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
Ooh okay, I'll check those out üòä

[16-Mar-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811

She got annoyed because he kept wondering about where I was at lunch

[20-Mar-18 08:46 PM] josh#8811
Ah I see

[20-Mar-18 08:46 PM] josh#8811
I hope he stops asking

[20-Mar-18 08:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs so weird, isn‚Äôt it? It is a little controlling

[20-Mar-18 08:47 PM] josh#8811
It's very controlling, he doesn't need to know where you are when you don't want to have any relationship with him

[20-Mar-18 08:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, it‚Äôs none of his business

[20-Mar-18 08:47 PM] josh#8811
Yeah!

[20-Mar-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe he was afraid we were making out in the janitors closet hehe

I have no idea

[20-Mar-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
All I know is that he hates you because you are better than him in almost every aspect

[20-Mar-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
And you have my attention

[20-Mar-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Mar-18 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Mar-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811

[20-Mar-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811
Yeah hehe

[20-Mar-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811
In group chats I don't get it, he acts like he likes me and everything, I just don't get it

[20-Mar-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well it‚Äôs because he feels weak without me because I gave him power, so he is trying to grasp anyone he can to give him any sort of attention

[20-Mar-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811
That makes a lot of sense

[20-Mar-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811
All he does is talk and talk

[20-Mar-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811
He really tries to make himself look better than others, I think

[20-Mar-18 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah?

[20-Mar-18 08:56 PM] josh#8811

Maybe he's pretending to like me just like I pretend to like him

[20-Mar-18 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, just to have more people ‚Äúon his side.‚Äù Maddie did that with holly even though they hated each other

[20-Mar-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
Ugh, well it's definitely not working for me, and James too cause we talked about how he was acting in the group chat earlier and we don't really like it

There's this one picture you sent me, where you're in the bathroom with your shirt pulled up just below your breasts and you're in your underwear. Your hips look so amazing, and omg I'm getting hard again staring at the bulge your pussy makes against your underwear. You have no idea how much I want to see it

I tried to lie down for a nap earlier, but I kept thinking about being with you and I couldn't help but involuntarily grind against my pillow and my covers. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and pulled my pajama pants down so I could stroke myself, and I repeated that a few times

I had cider a couple times last year, during Christmas and stuff. Last summer at the end though... Man that was kinda crazy. I stayed in a house with  a couple of German teens and I think I got slightly drunk. I can say more, but I'm not very proud about it

[26-Mar-18 10:29 PM] josh#8811
So around August (?), I went with my mom and sister to my sister's friend's house up in Tahoe. We got to stay there with the family for a week, and their extended family (a 14yo girl and 17yo boy from Germany) stayed too. There was also a 14yo boy in the immediate family as well. All of us teens (so not my sis and her friend) stayed in a second story of the house, above the garage in this room with several beds. This room was super close to a small room absolutely filled with alcohol. After a couple of nights, after we all got comfortable around each other, the 14yo boy and girl decided that it would be a great idea to pull all nighters and sneak alcohol into the bedroom. I absolutely jumped at the opportunity to try hard alcohol for the first time, and for some reason we completely hid it from the other 17yo boy who slept. I think the most I had in one sitting was around three servings of alcohol, and I felt all giddy and a little dizzy afterwards. We played uno where the losers took a drink, and it was overall really fun. I have a recording of me at like five in the morning talking, which I can share with you

[26-Mar-18 10:29 PM] josh#8811

Why?

[26-Mar-18 10:50 PM] josh#8811
So I've known James for a pretty long time now; we've hung out after school since freshman year. The thing with him is that when he gets more comfortable around you or anyone, he pokes at them as a sort of friendly affection. If he didn't feel confident around you, he would be afraid to joke around with you like that. I don't think he understands that you're insecure about the way you laugh and that you actually want him to stop

[26-Mar-18 10:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh okay, I understand

[26-Mar-18 10:51 PM] josh#8811

Do you think you're bi? I mean, it really sounds like you have that sort of attraction to both boys and girls

I think so, but I don‚Äôt really feel like labeling it

[27-Mar-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
I respect that, labels can be kinda weird when it comes to sexuality

[27-Mar-18 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[27-Mar-18 10:34 PM] josh#8811
Like I'm pretty sure I'm straight lol but saying I'm straight feels like a box or something

[27-Mar-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
What do you mean?

[27-Mar-18 10:36 PM] josh#8811
Actually I'm not sure, cause I've never really had romantic feelings towards men but I'm pretty sure I've had some thoughts like "I'd smash lmao" around, maybe a few times? I don't think I could have a relationship with a guy, but I don't feel disgusted when I see a dick so I assume I'm not completely straight you know?

[27-Mar-18 10:37 PM] josh#8811

Haha

[27-Mar-18 10:38 PM] josh#8811
But yeah I definitely don't have a strong enough attraction for me to notice it unless I really think about it, so I don't really label that

[27-Mar-18 10:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that makes sense

[27-Mar-18 10:40 PM] josh#8811
Is Ms Ragey the human sexuality teacher? I remember you said you have her on Wednesdays

Oh okay!

I just got home, I'll be on in a minute or two; I need to make sure I have no chores first

How are you?

[28-Mar-18 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty good, how are you?

[28-Mar-18 08:39 PM] josh#8811
I was feeling good earlier, but volunteering at the church gave me anxiety so I'm just calming down right now and feeling okay

[28-Mar-18 08:40 PM] josh#8811
How was your evening?

[28-Mar-18 08:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty good, I did some yoga and such

Oh no, why?

[28-Mar-18 08:45 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry, is there anything I can do to help?

[28-Mar-18 08:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs just hormones and weird people and stress

[28-Mar-18 08:47 PM] josh#8811
I'm really sorry honey, do you want to talk about it?

[28-Mar-18 08:48 PM] josh#8811
I'm here for you but if you also need space that's okay too

[28-Mar-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay when I say this don‚Äôt freak out because it‚Äôs not your fault, even my mom has this and she‚Äôs been married for 18 years

[28-Mar-18 08:49 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[28-Mar-18 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
When you get to a certain point in your menstrual cycle you find boys gross. This is like 1 or 2 weeks before your period

[28-Mar-18 08:50 PM] josh#8811
Aww really? I'm okay with that

[28-Mar-18 08:51 PM] josh#8811
Do you need space from me, is there anything that I should change with my behavior to help?

[28-Mar-18 08:51 PM] josh#8811
Also thank you for telling me

[28-Mar-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000

I just feel very indifferent about stuff and I‚Äôm figuring myself out

[28-Mar-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[28-Mar-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811
Is there anything that you need from me, like do I need to change anything?

[28-Mar-18 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
No

[28-Mar-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811
Alright then

[28-Mar-18 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just so confused

[28-Mar-18 08:57 PM] josh#8811
About what?

[28-Mar-18 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Everything

[28-Mar-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[28-Mar-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Do you want to talk about it?

[28-Mar-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs kinda hard for me to put it into words without creating an essay. Maybe ask about something specific?

[28-Mar-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
Okay, well what do you mean by everything? Can you list what you're confused about?

[28-Mar-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Who I like, who I want to be with

[28-Mar-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
Are you unsure about being with me?

[28-Mar-18 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I want to be with you. I‚Äôm just trying to figure everything out because I‚Äôve finally accepted it and brought it forward

[28-Mar-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
Okay, that brings me a lot of relief. Are you saying that you've accepted your sexuality?

[28-Mar-18 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes. I‚Äôve never been with a girl, but I like the thought of it. That‚Äôs what is confusing to me. I don‚Äôt have solid evidence for that, but I‚Äôve met girls that I wouldn‚Äôt mind dating

[28-Mar-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
That's understandable

[28-Mar-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
Thinking of us seeing other people breaks my heart, but are you considering trying a relationship with a woman in the future?

[28-Mar-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Honestly, I don‚Äôt know

[28-Mar-18 09:08 PM] josh#8811
Do you think you like girls more? I'm sorry if I'm asking the wrong questions

[28-Mar-18 09:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôve had more crushes on girls than boys but I don‚Äôt have solid evidence because I‚Äôve never been with a girl

[28-Mar-18 09:09 PM] josh#8811
I mean, it's possible then I guess

[28-Mar-18 09:10 PM] josh#8811
What else are you thinking about?

[28-Mar-18 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt know

[28-Mar-18 09:11 PM] josh#8811
That's okay

[28-Mar-18 09:13 PM] josh#8811
I think I noticed you were feeling like this during lunch, cause I got really stressed out during summit reads and sent those messages

[28-Mar-18 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just know that none of this is your fault

[28-Mar-18 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just need someone to talk about this stuff with because it‚Äôs not like I could go to my mom

[28-Mar-18 09:14 PM] josh#8811
That's okay, you can always talk to me about anything

[28-Mar-18 09:16 PM] josh#8811
I have to admit I get stressed out talking about it but you said you want to be with me, and I'm here to support you for everything. I'm your friend too, as well as your partner

[28-Mar-18 09:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm still *very* attracted boys, don‚Äôt worry

[28-Mar-18 09:19 PM] josh#8811
And I'm very glad you are, thank you for reassuring me. It's stupid lol, no matter what happens I always start thinking you don't want me anymore but I know it's not true. What else would you like to talk about? You said there's a lot on your mind, are there any talking points I missed?

[28-Mar-18 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Dane stroked my arm and said ‚ÄúI like the design on your sweater‚Äù

[28-Mar-18 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I literally threw up in my mouth

[28-Mar-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
Oh my god

[28-Mar-18 09:21 PM] josh#8811
He better stay away from you

[28-Mar-18 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000

[28-Mar-18 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also a bunch of boys were talking about me on the stairwell

[28-Mar-18 09:21 PM] josh#8811
I heard you talking about that

[28-Mar-18 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000

[28-Mar-18 09:22 PM] josh#8811
What the heck

[28-Mar-18 09:22 PM] josh#8811
Something is up

[28-Mar-18 09:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
They were younger though

[28-Mar-18 09:23 PM] josh#8811
Like, maybe everyone knows you're single or maybe whoever saw us in the hallways said something

[28-Mar-18 09:23 PM] josh#8811
I mean, not single but they think you are

[28-Mar-18 09:23 PM] Deleted User#0000

[28-Mar-18 09:24 PM] josh#8811

[28-Mar-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
Okay just a quick question sorry

[28-Mar-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Plus why would they care that I was with someone if they don‚Äôt even know my name

[28-Mar-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes?

[28-Mar-18 09:27 PM] josh#8811
Should I stay away from saying romantic/sexual stuff when you're grossed out by boys? Like, should I turn into a friend only sort of guy until you like me again?

[28-Mar-18 09:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Haha probably no sexual stuff unless I initiate it

[28-Mar-18 09:28 PM] josh#8811

Also I wanted to say I'm sorry if in parts of my conversation with you made me seem like I wanted to spend less time with you. I'd honestly spend all day by your side if I could; I was only making suggestions about space because I thought you wanted it. I love you very much and I'm excited to see you and talk to you more

[28-Mar-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Aww as I said before, I‚Äôd have you sit on my lap all day if you could

[28-Mar-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
...

[28-Mar-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
So boxers are like thin shorts, but your hanging junk has to go on one side or the other which is stupid. Briefs kinda support your stuff and they're tighter so if you have a boner it doesn't show really, and I like that a lot üòÇ

[28-Mar-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000

I honestly really love you, like 100%. If we could move in together or something, and start a life together after or during college I would die from happiness. I don't want to date around, I feel like you're the one, you know? I'm sorry if I'm going too far because we're young but that's how I feel

[28-Mar-18 10:24 PM] josh#8811
Like, when you went on my phone and stuff I felt absolutely comfortable with the idea of you going through it, even though I never share my phone with anyone. I know that's a silly example but I feel it reflects how I feel a little

I finished my workout and I'm going to sleep now (it's 11:25), but before I do I want to say a few things because I love you. I love you so much Hannah, I love you with all my heart. I don't know if we'll be able to go to the same college for the first two years, but I will do my best to stay in your life as your partner. If I can't go to St. Mary's, I'll try to live close by in an apartment and attend a community college so we can see each other more. Sometimes I imagine us living together, like renting a house or apartment after or during college, and just having a great time. There's so much that we can do together, I just can't wait. I love you so much, I can't wait to start my life with you. I also really care about you. Thank you very much for talking with me about your feelings and your sexuality. If you ever need me to back off and give you space, please tell me right away. I love being direct with my feelings and hearing how you feel immediately. I also love being there to listen to you and give you support. I can't wait to talk to you tomorrow and share chocolate with you. I love you so much, sweet dreams ‚ô•Ô∏èüòö

I can only spend so much time in the bathroom, but you better be back in that classroom

[29-Mar-18 01:37 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry I can't come back

[29-Mar-18 03:49 PM] josh#8811
I first want to say that I'm sorry for approaching things the way I did. I value our relationship, but during lunch when I walked out and said hi to you, something clicked in my mind that you didn't want to talk to me. I've tried so, so hard to convince myself in the moment but my social anxiety just takes over and I automatically give you space. I feel so weak. It is so stupid and I'm very mad at myself. I love being with you, it's great. I just can't start that action of having conversations or getting your attention, because every single time, my brain makes me think that you don't want me to approach you. I hate it.

I'm very sorry for suggesting that it would be better if I sometimes don't join the friend group and leave you alone. Looking back, I think I suggested that because I thought you would not be stressed by my presence. I know that's not true, but I couldn't help but think it.

[29-Mar-18 03:50 PM] josh#8811
I feel really bad, because I know that talking to you out of desperation without collecting my thoughts made you feel bad and probably angry, and I can't forgive myself for making that happen. 

Next week, I would appreciate it so, so much if you took the initiative to start a one on one conversation with me. I feel guilty for relying on you for this, but I promise that after one or two times I will get better and start initiating things too because I've seen you approach me in real life and it will convince me that you enjoy talking to me. I love talking to you, I really relish my time with you. I promise that I will be able to build my confidence with approaching you faster, please hold me to it. 

I also want to say that when I talked about how I felt in groups with you, I didn't remember some things and I left them out. When you smirk at me after our eyes meet, it absolutely makes my day. I love it when you give me that look, so much. It screams "hey this relationship is real, don't worry" and it helps me so much with my confidence.

[29-Mar-18 03:50 PM] josh#8811
I guess to conclude things, I think I'm very sensitive about body language and when I feel insecure I take every single thing you do and my brain amplifies it, so that it convinces me that you don't want my attention. I promise, I'm doing my best to work on this and I know that it will go away faster when I spend more time with you. 

The situation that we're in really sucks, and I really wish that we could date in the open. I know that I wouldn't have these insecurities if we were able to show each other how we feel by hugging and stuff. I promise that you won't have to deal with this in the future when we can date. This is a temporary problem, and I'm sure that I can get rid of it even before we start dating in the open. 

Thank you so much for understanding how I feel. I am so grateful for your empathy and I promise that I'm going to be less insecure. I'm really sorry for walking out on you during lunch.

[29-Mar-18 05:01 PM] josh#8811
Also I read this a couple of times and I still don't think I expressed how bad my insecurities are when I'm at lunch or break, and at the same time I haven't expressed how much I love spending time with you as soon as I realize you're enjoying it. Please feel free to ask me questions tonight if you need more information

Why is that?

[30-Mar-18 10:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
She kept laughing and making fun of Aspen. She called them ‚Äúit.‚Äù And I can understand not agreeing with different identities, whatever. But being disrespectful is too much, especially since they are figuring themselves out

[30-Mar-18 10:40 PM] josh#8811
Oh my goodness, that is really terrible. I am so sorry that she acted that way, I can't believe it

I told her ‚Äúwhy do you not believe in it if it‚Äôs being taught in school?‚Äù And she didn‚Äôt have a good comeback

[30-Mar-18 10:44 PM] josh#8811
I think it sounds like she doesn't understand that ideologies change and it's not okay to discriminate against something that is different than what you're used to

[30-Mar-18 10:45 PM] josh#8811
Like I get that she's old so maybe to her it's not the "normal thing," but what she does is not okay

[30-Mar-18 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah and Rylee has caught onto it and ughhhhh

[30-Mar-18 10:47 PM] josh#8811
Wait what the hell, didn't you tell me he's queer? Shouldn't he understand what Aspen is going through and how calling someone that is demeaning?

Hehe that's alright, I rarely watch it and when I do, I always pause it after a couple of minutes and just use my imagination instead

Lol what did you look up?

[31-Mar-18 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Idk stuff I‚Äôm personally into. But I end up critiquing the video instead of enjoying it

[31-Mar-18 10:24 PM] josh#8811
What kind of critiques?

[31-Mar-18 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like most of the ones I watched were *in medias res* and the camera angles were horrible and I could barely hear what they were saying

[31-Mar-18 10:25 PM] josh#8811
What's in medias res?

[31-Mar-18 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just like in the middle of a situation without context

[31-Mar-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
When I see porn, a lot of it just doesn't look like normal sex

[31-Mar-18 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah it‚Äôs very unrealistic

[31-Mar-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
Oh yeah, it's a bit of a turn off

[31-Mar-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
There's no intimacy for the most part

[31-Mar-18 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Unless they are home videos. But most of the time they are paid actors who just met

[31-Mar-18 10:27 PM] josh#8811
Yeah that's true, I think when I watched porn more some time ago I would always look up the "amatuer stuff"

In one of the videos they thought it was good idea for the girl to have sex in her moms bed while her mom was sleeping there. EVEN THOUGH THE GIRL HAD HER OWN ROOM. And then the mom woke up and was like ‚Äúwhat the fuck is this??‚Äù And he was like ‚Äú....uh‚Äù and she said ‚Äúa family who fucks together stays together‚Äù lmaooooo

[01-Apr-18 11:10 PM] josh#8811
Hehe I can send you a video next time, I'll type out how I go through it:

[01-Apr-18 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay üòã

[01-Apr-18 11:13 PM] josh#8811
So since I'm uncircumcised (which is awesome), I basically don't need lube or anything. At the start, when I'm horny, I usually reach my hand down my pants and start rubbing my head through my foreskin when I'm semi erect. Then when I can't take it anymore, I pull my pants down and start stroking as I get harder and harder. It feels so good making my cock erect all the way, I can't describe it. After that, I start stroking quicker up and down the head of my cock, and then take a little break and do slow strokes along my whole length

[01-Apr-18 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
I absolutely love the thought of that

If you feel comfortable, who did you masturbate to until recently?

[01-Apr-18 11:22 PM] josh#8811
I think it was pretty much to you, Maja and Ivonne. Lol for more detail I tried thinking about Sandee too, but it just didn't do anything for me. I also felt sort of guilty because you guys were all my friends, but I mean hormones right? As soon as I started supporting you more and messaging you, I slowly just stopped thinking about those guys.

[01-Apr-18 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000

Do you want me to be dominant the first time I give you a blow job or do you want to?

[03-Apr-18 11:17 PM] josh#8811
Hmm, I'm not really sure

[03-Apr-18 11:17 PM] josh#8811
Would you like to be dominant?

[03-Apr-18 11:17 PM] josh#8811
I think I could go either way

I am a complete virgin when it comes to this stuff so I think it might be a good idea to expect me to come off as more vanilla at first, I hope you're okay with that

[03-Apr-18 11:24 PM] josh#8811
I feel like I won't know what the best pressure to put on your clit and stuff at first, because I may be afraid of giving too much so you'll probably have to guide me

Laying on my back with on leg up is great because it has a lot of stimulation, but I can‚Äôt get as deep

[04-Apr-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
Ooh okay, well maybe I can get deeper?

[04-Apr-18 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Doggy style is similar but the mental part makes it more exciting

[04-Apr-18 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe

[04-Apr-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
Oooh, what about the mental part?

[04-Apr-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000

Oooh, I'd love to do those things

[04-Apr-18 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
The one issue is my bone makes it a little difficult. Maybe it would be easier with something more flexible, idk

[04-Apr-18 10:36 PM] josh#8811

If you prefer, you can always try sitting down on it first as well

What about the bathroom? Does it have a bath mat you can sit on? You can put some toilet paper down too

[05-Apr-18 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I could do that, maybe. I‚Äôd rather just wait a few more minutes and then go onto my bedroom floor

[05-Apr-18 09:36 PM] josh#8811
I think that's a better idea

I honestly forgot about it, it‚Äôs not a big deal at all

[05-Apr-18 10:32 PM] josh#8811
The reason I'm so upset with myself is because I'm comparing myself to how Spencer always pushed for more and eventually got what he wanted when you didn't feel comfortable, and I'm seeing myself do the same thing and it's worrying me. I know I didn't do all the horrible things that he did but every time I start wanting more I can see myself slip, and this time I felt like I went too far

[05-Apr-18 10:32 PM] josh#8811

You are a wonderful person. I‚Äôm just a little shy about my body, I can‚Äôt control it. You didn‚Äôt keep pushing for me to do something, you asked once and stopped after I declined

[05-Apr-18 10:37 PM] josh#8811
Thank you very much for understanding, and thank you for saying I'm wonderful. You mean a lot to me and my greatest fear is hurting you or making you uncomfortable. I think that you have a beautiful body, with or without hair and I promise that I won't push to see something you're not comfortable showing. I love you very much

[05-Apr-18 10:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
See, the fact that (even though you aren‚Äôt in the wrong) you still recognized something that might have been a red alert and owned up to it shows that you are a good person

[05-Apr-18 11:02 PM] josh#8811
Ooh okay hehe

[05-Apr-18 11:03 PM] josh#8811
I feel like if I keep talking about that serious stuff the conversation might get a little sad

[05-Apr-18 11:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is it something you need to tell me?

[05-Apr-18 11:04 PM] josh#8811
I don't really know, kind of?

[05-Apr-18 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then tell me

[05-Apr-18 11:07 PM] josh#8811
Lol okay, well it's kind of stupid but I was thinking of this week how we get super intimate online and how we're really super close there, but when I see you either during lunch or our apes block there's this big difference where we act like we're barely friends and only sneak hand holding sometimes. It made me pretty sad because it's like I have to flip a switch, until you give me a sign like a smirk or something and then I have to express my feelings as well and it just jumbles up my emotions

[05-Apr-18 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just know I‚Äôm literally never myself at school. The only time I truly feel myself is when I am texting you

[05-Apr-18 11:10 PM] josh#8811
That makes me feel relieved but also sad that you have to do that

[05-Apr-18 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs like polar opposites. At school I‚Äôm dead silent and barely there. When I‚Äôm texting you or at home I‚Äôm really loud and sassy

[05-Apr-18 11:11 PM] josh#8811
Aw honey ‚òπÔ∏è

[05-Apr-18 11:11 PM] josh#8811

It‚Äôs just, if you are always so down about something then it‚Äôs bound to go wrong

[05-Apr-18 11:17 PM] josh#8811
It's okay

[05-Apr-18 11:18 PM] josh#8811
The reason I'm always veiwing things so negatively is because when I was raised, my mom always made empty promises and still does. I always expect things to go wrong and they usually do, it sucks

[05-Apr-18 11:19 PM] josh#8811
Like, I let my guard down when we started hanging out more and then your mom basically shut me out and now I'm afraid to hope for anything more

I could never leave you, I know that I want to be with you throughout and after college, but I'm always expecting for the worst to come in between that time that we get to finally be a real couple

[05-Apr-18 11:22 PM] josh#8811
Maybe that's true, but I still don't think your mom will be happy when she finds out we're together if you tell her when you turn 18

[05-Apr-18 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well too bad, because she can‚Äôt force me to not talk to anyone

Hehe that's true

[05-Apr-18 11:24 PM] josh#8811
But she did try to force you, and I have a feeling you don't really have a freedom to date me yet. I'm sure it will change in the future

[05-Apr-18 11:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like literally she has no control over who I talk to. There is no rule book saying that parents are allowed to ban their child from talking to someone (unless it‚Äôs a pedofile or something similar obviously)

Aw what happened?

[08-Apr-18 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
So with the kind I use, I have to pull the applicator until it clicks. This ensures that the actual tampon will push out completely. But I didn‚Äôt know that until yesterday, because I kept putting it up in there, pulling it out, and still having the tampon in the applicator

Oh no!

Some younger girl who used to go to Everest

Hmm I can‚Äôt find her

[08-Apr-18 10:41 PM] josh#8811
That's alright

[08-Apr-18 10:41 PM] josh#8811
How do you feel about that news? Did he tell your mom?

[08-Apr-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
He told my mom

[08-Apr-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
That's a little interesting that he told her that

[08-Apr-18 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, it‚Äôs like he wants me to kjow

[08-Apr-18 10:45 PM] josh#8811
Hmm...

[08-Apr-18 10:46 PM] josh#8811
Well, that could mean two or more things I think

[08-Apr-18 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh? I have my own theory but I want to hear yours first

[08-Apr-18 10:47 PM] josh#8811
Well, I think he's either trying to make you jealous, or prove to you that he doesn't need you, or make you mad that he's over you. I'm not sure if I'm right though, I barely know him

[08-Apr-18 10:47 PM] josh#8811
I don't think he's over you though

[08-Apr-18 10:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well there isn‚Äôt a younger Angela who went to Everest so ü§î

[08-Apr-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
Hmm that's weird...

[08-Apr-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
Do you think he's making it up?

[08-Apr-18 10:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, that‚Äôs my theory

[08-Apr-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
Woah, that's *pretty* weird

[08-Apr-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah

[08-Apr-18 10:49 PM] josh#8811
Like, if you're right then he's maybe moved on to the bargaining stage or something, like doing something to make you react

[08-Apr-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
There‚Äôs an *Angelina*, but she still attends Everest

[08-Apr-18 10:49 PM] josh#8811
That's strange

[08-Apr-18 10:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
My mom was reading right from the texts too, so it‚Äôs not like she forgot it

[08-Apr-18 10:51 PM] josh#8811
Huh weirrrd

[08-Apr-18 10:51 PM] josh#8811
I think you're right

[08-Apr-18 10:51 PM] josh#8811
He probably made it up

[08-Apr-18 10:51 PM] josh#8811
I mean, there's no way for him to contact her right? You hadn't really heard about this girl before

[08-Apr-18 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I checked the yearbook. I don‚Äôt think anyone named Angela has attended the school at all

[08-Apr-18 10:52 PM] josh#8811
Wow okay, weird

[08-Apr-18 10:52 PM] josh#8811
Unless they attended a bit in freshman year but left before photo time?

[08-Apr-18 10:53 PM] josh#8811
Even then, that's pretty slim

[08-Apr-18 10:53 PM] josh#8811
And it would be super unlikely for him to meet this person outside of Everest

[08-Apr-18 10:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
But would that be enough time to get a phone number? And if they were close enough to be flirty like that now, why don‚Äôt I know about her?

[08-Apr-18 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
He said that she attended Everest and then left

[08-Apr-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
Exactly! There's no way this girl exists

[08-Apr-18 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I agree

[08-Apr-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
I think the best course of action right now is to pretend like she's real and just go with what he says

[08-Apr-18 10:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I guess

[08-Apr-18 10:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will mention my doubts to my mom though

[08-Apr-18 10:55 PM] josh#8811
Okay, I think that's definitely a good idea

[08-Apr-18 10:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because I said no one named Angela has attended Everest ever earlier

[08-Apr-18 10:55 PM] josh#8811
Oh yeah?

[08-Apr-18 10:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah when she first mentioned it

[08-Apr-18 10:56 PM] josh#8811

Oh yeah

[08-Apr-18 10:57 PM] josh#8811
Do you think he's moved on to the bargaining stage? Like, this is a way to try and get your attention back to him?

[08-Apr-18 10:58 PM] josh#8811
I'm trying to connect his actions to that five stages of grief thing

[08-Apr-18 10:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think so

[08-Apr-18 10:58 PM] Deleted User#0000

[09-Apr-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Wait you put the applicator in wrong?

[09-Apr-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
So I put the applicator in correctly, but it was too far in. I decided it was a good idea to sit down and pull it out a little, but that was a horrible idea because it changed the direction

[09-Apr-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I pushed it right into the sensitive parts apparently

[09-Apr-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
Aw oh my gosh, that sounds pretty painful

Ow what? That sounds really bad!

[09-Apr-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811

How was your day?

[09-Apr-18 09:15 PM] josh#8811
I got to be home alone all day, so I was lazy and spent the whole day lying in bed and alternating between watching YouTube and masturbating üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[09-Apr-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
What advice did he give?

[09-Apr-18 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like to keep being true to myself and tell mom, she‚Äôll eventually accept it. He also said to ask mom to get me better lube üòÇ

[09-Apr-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
Omg haha üòÇ

[09-Apr-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
He's right about both things!

[09-Apr-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
Lol I'm not sure mineral oil is the best lube, and I'm sure that your mom will eventually accept your sexuality if you think you should be open and tell her about it

Alright. Well I have this wart on my big toe. I have no clue why, my mom just said that she had the same thing when she was younger. I‚Äôve had it frozen with liquid nitrogen soooo many times, both professionally and at home. But it never dies and I‚Äôm really embarrassed about it. I thought I killed it a few weeks ago when I used this acid thing, but nevertheless it came back

[11-Apr-18 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I‚Äôve like cried over it

[11-Apr-18 10:52 PM] josh#8811
I gotta give you the backstory

[11-Apr-18 10:52 PM] josh#8811
Oops you can't see it that well

[11-Apr-18 10:53 PM] josh#8811
So, when I was in 5th grade I fell on my elbow on asphalt with long sleeves on

[11-Apr-18 10:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay

[11-Apr-18 10:53 PM] josh#8811
And I somehow tore the skin off, but I was an idiot and taped it back on üòÇ

[11-Apr-18 10:53 PM] josh#8811
So now it looks all ugly and weird when I have a straight arm, it's like a big red wrinkly wart

[11-Apr-18 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Haha that‚Äôs okay

[11-Apr-18 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
But that‚Äôs just a little scar from falling

[11-Apr-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
True, but a lot of people asked about it over the years cause it's hard to hide

[11-Apr-18 10:55 PM] josh#8811
Eventually I got comfortable having it out, but at first when people asked it reminded me it was there and embarrassed me

[11-Apr-18 10:55 PM] josh#8811
I think the moral of my story is that I came to terms with it and accepted that it was how my elbow looked and I shouldn't have to hide it

[11-Apr-18 10:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I see

No it‚Äôs okay, I know you are trying

[11-Apr-18 10:56 PM] josh#8811
I'm not sure I can relate to how you feel because it sounds like you're really insecure about your wart, and I'm really sorry that you are

[11-Apr-18 10:57 PM] josh#8811
Is there any way I can help you?

[11-Apr-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt know. I think the reason why I‚Äôm so ashamed of it is because I was teased when I was younger

Who teased you?

[11-Apr-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I felt like it was something I could be open about but I guess not

[11-Apr-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Some girl in my class

[11-Apr-18 10:58 PM] josh#8811
I don't know who she is but she sounds mean!

[11-Apr-18 10:58 PM] josh#8811
That wasnt okay of her

In elementary school we had this thing about lining up. Whenever we did anything, it had to be in a line. So we were lined up for class. And you know that little kid song ‚Äúfirst is the worst, second is the best...‚Äù well she made me the 4th person and said ‚Äúfourth is the one with the wart!‚Äù And I was absolutely mortified

[11-Apr-18 11:00 PM] josh#8811
Oh my god, what?

[11-Apr-18 11:00 PM] josh#8811
What the hell!

[11-Apr-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I find it stupid now, but little kid me was very sad so ever since then I was ashamed of it

[11-Apr-18 11:01 PM] josh#8811
Honey, I am so sorry that she teased you like that

[11-Apr-18 11:01 PM] josh#8811
Sure, maybe it's stupid to you now but it sounds like that practically changed your life!

Well my mom was so open and understanding, I thought it was normal. But then I learned it was looked down upon and seen as dirty. Which I hate, because I‚Äôm not a dirty person at all. It‚Äôs just a stupid genetic thing that will eventually go away

[11-Apr-18 11:03 PM] josh#8811
I don't see it as dirty at all, I promise you that

[11-Apr-18 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm relieved to hear that

[11-Apr-18 11:04 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad you feel relieved, and I'm also very happy that you decided to share that part of yourself with me

[11-Apr-18 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Trust me, it took a lot of confidence to tell you that

[11-Apr-18 11:05 PM] josh#8811
Thank you for being brave enough to tell me, I mean it

[11-Apr-18 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Of course honey. Omg I got one on my thumb once, and I became a hermit

[11-Apr-18 11:06 PM] josh#8811
Aw oh no! I'm sorry honey

[11-Apr-18 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt know what the deal is, but I‚Äôve had quite a few

I think it might be good if you walk around barefoot with me the next time we hang out at home together

I really want to help you feel comfortable having your feet in the open

I had a moment of confidence because I thought I killed it, but today my dreams were crushed

It's gotta be in your DNA, like your body must be programmed to grow that for a while for whatever reason

Oh that's nice

[11-Apr-18 11:12 PM] josh#8811
I really hope you get better with your insecurities surrounding it and I really want to help you honey

[11-Apr-18 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope so too. The only time I don‚Äôt wear socks is bed and showers

[11-Apr-18 11:13 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow

[11-Apr-18 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which probably doesn‚Äôt help

[11-Apr-18 11:13 PM] josh#8811
I think I have a little bit of a plan that we can try, if you'd like to

[11-Apr-18 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh?

[11-Apr-18 11:14 PM] josh#8811
So, we've agreed showering together sounds really fun and something we'd love to do right? How about we take a shower together, and after we step out we get dressed but don't put socks on for the rest of the day, just inside the home

[11-Apr-18 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
That could be okay, or I can wake up and not put socks on until I need to go outside

[11-Apr-18 11:16 PM] josh#8811
Yeah! That sounds like a better idea üòÖ

[11-Apr-18 11:16 PM] josh#8811
Plus you can try that out sooner too

[11-Apr-18 11:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I don‚Äôt think I could ever wear flip flops to school though

[11-Apr-18 11:18 PM] josh#8811
Hmm, what about wearing flip flops to the store?

[11-Apr-18 11:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt care about strangers. I care about what people I know think

[11-Apr-18 11:19 PM] josh#8811
That's a good point

[11-Apr-18 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like if you told me to come to a pool party that had a bunch of people from school, I‚Äôd say no for that reason

[11-Apr-18 11:19 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow ‚òπÔ∏è

[11-Apr-18 11:20 PM] josh#8811
Do you think talking about it more would help?

[11-Apr-18 11:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I guess normalizing it might help some

[11-Apr-18 11:21 PM] josh#8811
Like, either now or in college if you have a deep conversation with your friends about insecurities you could bring that up; talking about it is a good first step, right?

[11-Apr-18 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I guess so. It‚Äôll take a lot of courage though

[11-Apr-18 11:21 PM] josh#8811
Yeah, that's true

[11-Apr-18 11:21 PM] josh#8811
It will be really hard at first but I promise it will get better after that

[11-Apr-18 11:22 PM] josh#8811
It's hard for me to put myself in your shoes, I'm not sure if my advice is the best to take

[11-Apr-18 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I mean, I was on the verge of panic just telling you. And we are really close, so I can‚Äôt imagine how I could tell a casual friend

[11-Apr-18 11:24 PM] josh#8811
Woah hey, wow that sounds really bad

[11-Apr-18 11:24 PM] josh#8811

Honey, I am so sorry

[11-Apr-18 11:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it‚Äôs like, how can I be so self conscious about a tiny thing on my toe? It sounds ridiculous. But I just can‚Äôt handle it for whatever reason

[11-Apr-18 11:26 PM] josh#8811
Exactly, to me it sounds like such a small thing to be insecure about; it sounds like the way others have treated you have caused you to hide it like this

[11-Apr-18 11:27 PM] josh#8811
I promise, I'm going to do my best to help you feel better about your wart. I don't know how I can, but I promise that I'll try my best

[11-Apr-18 11:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would say to not make a huge deal out of it. I make it a huge deal, but please don‚Äôt amplify it

[11-Apr-18 11:29 PM] josh#8811
Okay, thanks for telling me. Like, don't point it out or anything?

[11-Apr-18 11:29 PM] Deleted User#0000

We jumped my mom's minivan that had a dead battery, and I got to drive it around the neighborhood; when I parked it to see a garage sale with my mom and sis, the battery died again so we had to get it replaced on the spot. That took a while, but after that I got to drive even more and it was fun üòÅ

I don't even have a permit yet, so I technically wasn't allowed to do all that driving; I'm almost done with my online classes though and I'm scheduling an appointment to either get my appointment or get my license around May or June

Typo

[13-Apr-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
What do you mean hole? Are you getting worse?

[13-Apr-18 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Im just starting to overthink and get nervous

[13-Apr-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
Okay, should we try and focus on a different subject instead?

[13-Apr-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I want to talk about it because it gets it out of my system

[13-Apr-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
Okay, let's talk about it

[13-Apr-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I put my computer away I felt frozen and my leg disappeared

[13-Apr-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like I couldn‚Äôt see it anymore

[13-Apr-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
Woah what the heck?

[13-Apr-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
Okay, honey that's a little alarming

[13-Apr-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt know

[13-Apr-18 09:55 PM] josh#8811
Has this kind of stuff happened recently?

[13-Apr-18 09:55 PM] josh#8811
Other than right now

[13-Apr-18 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Luckily I‚Äôm seeing Robert soon, but my stuff has been flaring up a lot lately and I‚Äôve been feeling off

[13-Apr-18 09:56 PM] josh#8811
Uh oh, that's not good

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad you're seeing him soon

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
Tomorrow?

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
Is there any new medication you're taking?

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
No

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
No supplements either?

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nope. Also I‚Äôve been watching mental health videos which hasn‚Äôt helped either

[13-Apr-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
Oh no ‚òπÔ∏è

[13-Apr-18 09:58 PM] josh#8811
Maybe you should take a break from that

[13-Apr-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. Because since I‚Äôm so interested in psychology, I thought why not watch videos on mental illnesses? But that kinda just added fuel to my issues instead of educating me

[13-Apr-18 09:59 PM] josh#8811
Oh jeez, I'm sorry to hear that

[13-Apr-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm sure it was nothing

[13-Apr-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
I think so too, maybe we're overthinking it

[13-Apr-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
The fact that it was muffled might be promising

[13-Apr-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
But even that. I could tell it was my mom talking

[13-Apr-18 10:01 PM] josh#8811
Oh really?

[13-Apr-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm not sure who she was talking to though

[13-Apr-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
Could you tell where the sound may have been coming from?

[13-Apr-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
My room

[13-Apr-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
Okay, inside it?

[13-Apr-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
That's a little creepy

[13-Apr-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, so I opened my door

[13-Apr-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
Wait where were you?

[13-Apr-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Right outside my bedroom door

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
Hmm...

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
She is in bed

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
Okay üò¨

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
And you're sure you heard a voice?

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
100%

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
Okay, shoot

[13-Apr-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I could tell they were words

[13-Apr-18 10:04 PM] josh#8811
The fact that you *know* is a little concerning

[13-Apr-18 10:04 PM] josh#8811
Usually minor day to day stuff wouldn't be that "clear as day"

[13-Apr-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
üòï

[13-Apr-18 10:04 PM] josh#8811
You'll tell Robert tomorrow right?

[13-Apr-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes

[13-Apr-18 10:05 PM] josh#8811
Okay that's good

[13-Apr-18 10:05 PM] josh#8811
When you said your leg was invisible, were you looking directly at it?

[13-Apr-18 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was sitting down, looking down

[13-Apr-18 10:05 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, okay

[13-Apr-18 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd blink and it would still go completely invisible

[13-Apr-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow, okay

[13-Apr-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
That is not good

[13-Apr-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
And omg I hope my bedsheets ruffled because I just heard my name

[13-Apr-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm getting way too paranoid

[13-Apr-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
Oh shoot, okay

[13-Apr-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
Honey, I need you to take some deep breaths

[13-Apr-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
Can you tell me how anxious/paranoid you are from 1-10?

[13-Apr-18 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Probably like a 6 or 7

[13-Apr-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
Okay, that's not good

[13-Apr-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
Is your bed light on?

[13-Apr-18 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I have the fish tank light and the little ones on my bed

[13-Apr-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
Okay good

[13-Apr-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
Please tell me if you're getting worse

[13-Apr-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
Do you feel like you're getting more paranoid?

[13-Apr-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm just overanalyzing everything at this point

[13-Apr-18 10:09 PM] josh#8811
Okay, thank you for telling me

[13-Apr-18 10:09 PM] josh#8811
What I'm doing right now is looking at side effects for Zoloft

[13-Apr-18 10:10 PM] josh#8811
If you are having hallucinations right now (which you most likely are), there has to be a cause for it

[13-Apr-18 10:10 PM] josh#8811
One option I'm thinking of is that your body is making more serotonin

[13-Apr-18 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I woke up in a weird mood today

[13-Apr-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
Yeah?

[13-Apr-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
How did you feel this morning?

[13-Apr-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
Also can you tell me how you thought you heard your name a few minutes ago?

[13-Apr-18 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
It was a whisper behind my right ear. It felt hot like someone was breathing on me

[13-Apr-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow

[13-Apr-18 10:12 PM] josh#8811
Okay, honey that's not good

[13-Apr-18 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm probably just having a bad day

[13-Apr-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811

It's possible, yeah

What is weird?

[13-Apr-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
My brain keeps changing the feeling of urgency. Like a minute ago I was freaking out, but now I‚Äôm all relaxed and chill about it

[13-Apr-18 10:14 PM] josh#8811
Woah, that's really strange

[13-Apr-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like I feel fine and ready for bed. But you just witnessed me freaking out

[13-Apr-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
Hmm, everything you're saying isn't matching up with what I thought you had

[13-Apr-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
Yeah that's true

[13-Apr-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
Please tell me if you get worse again

Uh oh

[13-Apr-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
Where in your head?

[13-Apr-18 10:17 PM] josh#8811
I just read a study that serotonin syndrome can cause auditory and visual hallucinations

[13-Apr-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
On the right side

[13-Apr-18 10:17 PM] josh#8811
As well as headaches

[13-Apr-18 10:17 PM] josh#8811
Hmm okay

[13-Apr-18 10:17 PM] josh#8811
Okay that's good

Maybe bring Advil to bed with you in case it gets worse?

[13-Apr-18 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000

[13-Apr-18 10:34 PM] josh#8811
If you need to do it again, bite your knuckles since they're more hardy

[13-Apr-18 10:34 PM] josh#8811
But please honey, if you feel yourself getting worse and you can't sleep please wake someone up or talk to me

[13-Apr-18 10:42 PM] josh#8811
Oh jeez

[13-Apr-18 10:42 PM] josh#8811
No crying?

[13-Apr-18 10:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
No

[13-Apr-18 10:42 PM] josh#8811
Hmmm

[13-Apr-18 10:42 PM] josh#8811
That sounds like bipolar or something

[13-Apr-18 10:42 PM] josh#8811
But this is so sudden

[13-Apr-18 10:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
We aren‚Äôt going down that road

[13-Apr-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
Okay, you're right

[13-Apr-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I might just be having a bad day

[13-Apr-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
Let's not talk about that

[13-Apr-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
Yeah

[13-Apr-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I felt very back and forth before I got medication. Like one second I was super sad and the next I was fine

[13-Apr-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
You did?

[13-Apr-18 10:44 PM] josh#8811
It sounds like you are having a bad day, yeah

[13-Apr-18 10:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think so too, because medication isn‚Äôt a cure. It just helps. My mom and Rylee have bad days too

[13-Apr-18 10:44 PM] josh#8811
Yeah?

[13-Apr-18 10:45 PM] josh#8811
That's probably good that everyone else has them, which means that this could very much be a normal fluke

[13-Apr-18 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
And since it‚Äôs been such a long time, it was just an explosion

[13-Apr-18 10:45 PM] josh#8811
Oh yeah, that's right

[13-Apr-18 10:46 PM] josh#8811
Okay, what do you think we should do right now?

I want to be here to support you the next time this happens, but I think you really need to tell someone in person awake or asleep if it escalates as much as biting like that or just general paranoia; there's only so much I can do over the phone

Apparently lots of people quit working out because of the way the progression is; first it's really easy to see a difference, but after a while you have to basically exponentially work more and more to see a difference

Visual and auditory hallucinations, disorganization, not worrying about certain health stuff, and idk if this is like a full-on thing but I‚Äôve thought that I was psychic for a long time

[16-Apr-18 12:21 AM] josh#8811
I can't fall asleep because I keep thinking about you and what might happen in the future, I also did some research about schizophrenia that you may already know

[16-Apr-18 12:22 AM] josh#8811
If you are diagnosed with it, you'll have over a 50% chance of recovering at least partially (and I will be there for you every step of the way)

[16-Apr-18 12:23 AM] josh#8811
From what you've described so far, this would be the "acute phase" where you suddenly or gradually have symptoms and get a diagnosis. This stage usually lasts around a month or two, before you go into remission and start recovering

[16-Apr-18 12:29 AM] josh#8811
Last year, my mom told me this story about a guy that injected mice with a cancer causing chemical and spent an hour next to the cage every day, "imagining" that the cancer would not develop in the mice. Usually the chemical was fatal, but every single mouse recovered fully after the tumors basically dissolved into their bodies, which never happens. I'm hoping that if I spend time every night before I go to sleep, thinking and thinking that you will recover, that it will hopefully make a difference. I want to do everything in my power to help you through this, and at this point I am desperate enough to try that crazy method in the hope that it will at least help you a little bit. I love you so much, and I cannot stand to see you suffer any more than you already have. I am so angry that this has to happen to you of all people

[16-Apr-18 12:29 AM] josh#8811

I think telling her would be a good idea, right?

[16-Apr-18 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôll tell my doctor soon

[16-Apr-18 08:40 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[16-Apr-18 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
But yeah, I‚Äôll see him in the corners of rooms. Once I saw him briefly leaning on my lap

[16-Apr-18 08:41 PM] josh#8811
Oh god that's creepy

[16-Apr-18 08:41 PM] josh#8811
The only advice I can offer is to try and confront it by running towards it but that's kinda scary

[16-Apr-18 08:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just saw it briefly

[16-Apr-18 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
It goes away when I move

[16-Apr-18 08:42 PM] josh#8811
Shoot

[16-Apr-18 08:42 PM] josh#8811
I guess the only option is to move?

[16-Apr-18 08:42 PM] josh#8811
I'm really sorry

[16-Apr-18 08:42 PM] josh#8811

I‚Äôve visually hallucinated with you there

[16-Apr-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000

Oh god, I know I told you that I saw floating heads but that was a really long time ago and went away

You were tripping out?

[16-Apr-18 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
My closet didn‚Äôt have any door or cover. I was looking into it and I saw human/animal heads circling around and they were yelling at me

[16-Apr-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811
What the heck, oh my god

[16-Apr-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811

I remember that you said it's possible you might have bipolar disorder, I'm relieved to see that the medication you were prescribed treats both bipolar and schizophrenia. Would you like to check in tomorrow during break? I can ask you how you're feeling if you're not busy talking to a friend

Well bipolar people can hallucinate, although it‚Äôs quite rare. But I don‚Äôt have the extreme mood changes and being super hyper

Oh true, you only cycled through moods once so it's kind of unlikely

I was asking the guy questions on Wednesday when I got my first of this set

[19-Apr-18 08:40 PM] josh#8811
Ooh, that sounds fun

[19-Apr-18 08:40 PM] josh#8811
Did you learn anything cool?

[19-Apr-18 08:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
I learned that the tube acts as a vacuum, and that‚Äôs how the blood gets sucked out

[19-Apr-18 08:41 PM] josh#8811
Ohhh, interesting

[19-Apr-18 08:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yup, and I was watching the entire time.
My mom on the other hand was about to pass out

[19-Apr-18 08:42 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness, I don't blame her! I almost passed out when I had to have one a few years ago

[19-Apr-18 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh dear haha

[19-Apr-18 08:42 PM] josh#8811
Hehe it's alright

[19-Apr-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt like how I have to not eat breakfast before

[19-Apr-18 08:43 PM] josh#8811
I don't like that either, doesn't it make you a bit shaky?

[19-Apr-18 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
It can make me feel light headed easier. But they need to test my natural cholesterol levels. Which is kind of stupid, as I‚Äôm a 17 year old vegan

[19-Apr-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
Yeah that's pretty stupid lol

[19-Apr-18 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also everything from the first test came back normal

[19-Apr-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
Oh interesting

[19-Apr-18 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
So it‚Äôs in my brain, yay

[19-Apr-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
Oh boy

[19-Apr-18 08:45 PM] josh#8811
At least they're pretty sure they know what it is?

[19-Apr-18 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I can‚Äôt get over it though

[19-Apr-18 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I‚Äôve become more and more aware of my symptoms because of it

[19-Apr-18 08:46 PM] josh#8811
I'm really sorry honey, I can't either, it's making me anxious. What do you mean more aware?

[19-Apr-18 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like I notice it more

[19-Apr-18 08:47 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, I'm sorry

[19-Apr-18 08:47 PM] josh#8811
That sounds like it's a really rough time

[19-Apr-18 08:47 PM] josh#8811
I hope that the medication starts to work

[19-Apr-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
The thing that frustrates me the most is that we weren‚Äôt given a specific answer, she just said it‚Äôs one or the other

[19-Apr-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
What do you think?

[19-Apr-18 08:50 PM] josh#8811
Well if it can't be both, it's got to be schizophrenia. You only exhibited signs of bipolar disorder once, and bipolar doesn't have hallucinations involved

[19-Apr-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
It does but it‚Äôs only in a certain type and it‚Äôs auditory

[19-Apr-18 08:51 PM] josh#8811
Bipolar has auditory hallucinations?

[19-Apr-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Only a certain kind does. Did you pick up on any symptoms that I have?

[19-Apr-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811
I only thought about your random hostility you told me about, and the rapid mood cycling you experienced last weekend

[19-Apr-18 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
The only thing is that I got really angry over a tiny thing, but that also falls under schizophrenia

[19-Apr-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811
It looks like for bipolar, hallucinations are mostly happening during an extreme mood phase, so not all the time

[19-Apr-18 08:53 PM] josh#8811
Hmm, yeah

[19-Apr-18 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
But I have hallucinations every day

[19-Apr-18 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
And there is a lot of visual stuff going on

[19-Apr-18 08:54 PM] josh#8811
Which is why I think it's schizophrenia, because that's more constant right?

[19-Apr-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, it‚Äôs more of an every day thing

[19-Apr-18 08:54 PM] josh#8811
Yeah

[19-Apr-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I‚Äôll see things like 700, or yesterday I saw a biker going into traffic, or nana for example

[19-Apr-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness, that's rough

[19-Apr-18 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also my voices are very mean, and I don‚Äôt think they are as extreme in that regard when it comes to bipolar

[19-Apr-18 08:56 PM] josh#8811
I agree, I think schizophrenia has really mean voices most of the time

[19-Apr-18 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, and they‚Äôll tell me bad things

[19-Apr-18 08:57 PM] josh#8811
What kind of bad things? I remember some things you told me, but I don't think I know the whole picture

[19-Apr-18 08:57 PM] josh#8811
Are you okay taking about it?

[19-Apr-18 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well a few will straight up insult me. But the really deep voice and the medium voice will tell me to jump in front of a car, or drop rylee while he‚Äôs rock climbing

[19-Apr-18 08:58 PM] josh#8811
Jesus, wow

[19-Apr-18 08:58 PM] josh#8811
They're deep?

[19-Apr-18 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
One is super deep sounding

[19-Apr-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
I don't like the sound of that

[19-Apr-18 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Omf

[19-Apr-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
Huh?

[19-Apr-18 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I heard someone whisper into my right ear and it made me jump a foot in the air

[19-Apr-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
Woah holy shit

[19-Apr-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
Honey I'm so sorry ‚òπÔ∏è

[19-Apr-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
That sounds terrible

[19-Apr-18 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay if it happens again, I‚Äôm going upstairs

[19-Apr-18 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm not doing this tonight

[19-Apr-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[19-Apr-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Good, thank you for taking that initiative

[19-Apr-18 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was listening to something so all I heard was ‚ÄúHannah, blah dah blah‚Äù

[19-Apr-18 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
It was so creepy

[19-Apr-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness, that sounds very creepy

[19-Apr-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I heard a bit more of the same murmuring after I took out my earbuds. But it has stopped

[19-Apr-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
Okay, that's good that it stopped

[19-Apr-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
You don't hear any murmuring right now?

[19-Apr-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
No. That was an outside voice, which is much worse

[19-Apr-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
Oh goodness, there's a difference?

[19-Apr-18 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
So my inside voices are the ones inside my head narrating and being mean. The outside voices are the ones that sound like someone is literally talking to me

[19-Apr-18 09:03 PM] josh#8811
I didn't realize there was a difference, wow

[19-Apr-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yup

[19-Apr-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it sounded like a woman was whispering into my ear

Goodness, really?

[19-Apr-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
I don't know what to say, I'm kind of shocked the brain can create that

[19-Apr-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
It was pretty loud and clear too, which is why I was so jumpy

[19-Apr-18 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I want to research it more

[19-Apr-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
Me too, I feel like we should both know a good deal about it

[19-Apr-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
The psychology book I gave you might have info on it

[19-Apr-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay. I was also planning on asking my doctors about it

[19-Apr-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
That's a good idea, you can ask them particular questions and stuff

[19-Apr-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I learned today that it might have to do with dopamine receptors

[19-Apr-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
Woah, hmm that's interesting

[19-Apr-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
This medication makes me super sleepy

[19-Apr-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
It's okay sweetie, we should say goodnight now

[19-Apr-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
I do have one more question though

[19-Apr-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay

[19-Apr-18 09:08 PM] josh#8811
Okay, so you know the inner voice that you have when you think? Do the inner voice hallucinations feel like that, like thinking voices?

[19-Apr-18 09:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
They aren‚Äôt voices I recognize. Imagine if you are thinking and other people come into your brain and take over your thoughts. Like they are all in the same realm, but these ones I don‚Äôt have control over

[19-Apr-18 09:09 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow

[19-Apr-18 09:11 PM] josh#8811
The reason I was asking is because sometimes I can't stop having conversations with myself in my own head, or talking to myself like I'm in the second person, and I didn't really notice it until I was researching schizophrenia. I don't think I have any form of it now that I know it sounds like strangers, and plus when I get like that it's rarely when I'm talking to people

[19-Apr-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is normal to think to yourself in your head. But with me it‚Äôs like if people were insulting me all the time

[19-Apr-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like it‚Äôs not me

[19-Apr-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000

His name is Mike, he‚Äôs been a family friend for a super long time

[20-Apr-18 09:50 PM] josh#8811
Oh that's nice, I'm sorry he came over during a bad time. What were you guys talking about when he came in?

[20-Apr-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
So my mom is terrified of my potential diagnosis, and she is holding onto every bit of hope that it is something else

[20-Apr-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
She knows someone who was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic, and I told her that she has severe depression and an eating disorder

[20-Apr-18 09:51 PM] josh#8811
Uh oh

[20-Apr-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, I'm really sorry to hear that; I've done the exact opposite, that's interesting

[20-Apr-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which triggered the thought that I want a serious disorder

[20-Apr-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
Oh no

[20-Apr-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it‚Äôs like, everyone is saying it‚Äôs this thing

[20-Apr-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs her way of dealing with bad news, she did the same thing with my depression

[20-Apr-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
So she was trying to find hope by mentioning that person, but you used that as a counter and she thought you wanted a serious diagnosis as a result?

[20-Apr-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes

[20-Apr-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
Goodness...

[20-Apr-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
It's true, everyone is saying it's schizophrenia

[20-Apr-18 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs hard for to grasp the thought, that‚Äôs all

[20-Apr-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
I agree, it must be hard for her as a parent to accept that

[20-Apr-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
I'm sure she'll come to terms with it

[20-Apr-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it‚Äôs like, Dr Frohlich (psychiatrist) said it‚Äôs either one or the other. And I‚Äôm not bipolar

[20-Apr-18 09:55 PM] josh#8811
Yeah, exactly! Plus, your mom is way less experienced with disorders, she doesn't know better

[20-Apr-18 09:55 PM] josh#8811
I mean you probably knew that though haha

[20-Apr-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, I‚Äôve done a ton of research and I had prior knowledge

[20-Apr-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Apr-18 09:55 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, I'm sorry

[20-Apr-18 09:56 PM] josh#8811
That sounds pretty stressful that she's acting that way, for both of you

[20-Apr-18 09:56 PM] josh#8811
It sounds like that's the first stage of grief

[20-Apr-18 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Apr-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000

It‚Äôs really tough on her, and all of my family members

[20-Apr-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
Woah, jeez that's a tough thing to say

[20-Apr-18 09:58 PM] josh#8811
It definitely sounds tough, this really came out of nowhere and diagnosises like schizophrenia can be very very scary (to me, at least)

[20-Apr-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because of the symptoms I‚Äôm experiencing, my mom told me that I don‚Äôt realize the seriousness of it

[20-Apr-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm totally like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, it‚Äôs whatever, yadayada‚Äù but it‚Äôs obviously not fine

[20-Apr-18 09:59 PM] josh#8811
No honey, she's right

[20-Apr-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
Ever since what happened, I've gotten really paranoid about what's going to happen next. I'm so worried about your future and our future as well. I posted anonymously to a schizophrenia forum asking what I should do, and I did a lot of research on how Zoloft may interact with abilify. To me, I feel like schizophrenia can either get better or worse, and I'm really afraid of you going through life in the pain that you're in now. But on the other side, it also gives an interesting perspective because what your mom said can represent how people think schizophrenia is super horrible, but isn't as terrible to the people actually experiencing it

[20-Apr-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
Is the rest of your family alright?

[20-Apr-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
People can have it and live totally (mostly) normal and successful lives. My aunt checks in with my mom daily, everyone else is constantly checking in with me

[20-Apr-18 10:05 PM] josh#8811
Do you feel like that's a bad or good thing, all of the checking in? Also I received a lot of replies online, every one of them told me not to worry about you too much because antipsychotics work pretty well

[20-Apr-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs good that they work well. And it‚Äôs good, but obviously can get overwhelming

[20-Apr-18 10:07 PM] josh#8811
Maybe when the amount of checking in starts to exceed the amount you need, you can ask your family not to check in as much so it doesn't cause you stress. And I'm very glad that they work well

[20-Apr-18 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs been regulated, so it should be fine

Wtf when do Jim and Pam get together, because it‚Äôs painful to watch her with that stupid fianc√© of hers ü§Æ

Hehehe üòÇ

[21-Apr-18 08:02 PM] josh#8811
You are so cute lol

[21-Apr-18 08:02 PM] josh#8811
I think they get together in the second or third season

[21-Apr-18 08:02 PM] josh#8811
And you're right! Omg I die inside when I see Jim's face and he way her fiance treats her

Huh?

[21-Apr-18 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I had therapy today

[21-Apr-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Robert told my dad to take me to a center that helps young adults with psychosis

[21-Apr-18 08:43 PM] josh#8811
What happened?

[21-Apr-18 08:43 PM] josh#8811
Woah okay

[21-Apr-18 08:43 PM] josh#8811
Hmm

[21-Apr-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I have schizophreniform

Yup

[21-Apr-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
I just looked that up

[21-Apr-18 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
So I had a few mental breakdowns today

[21-Apr-18 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah?

[21-Apr-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
Wait, so it's almost schizophrenia?

[21-Apr-18 08:44 PM] josh#8811
And I'm really sorry that you had breakdowns, would you like to talk about that?

[21-Apr-18 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs when you have signs. About 70% of people with it develop schizophrenia. So I‚Äôm in the danger zone

[21-Apr-18 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
I cried a ton today

[21-Apr-18 08:45 PM] josh#8811
Shoot I'm really sorry honey, I wish I knew what to do to help you feel better

I‚Äôm usually pretty good at figuring out, but it‚Äôs a blessing and a curse

I don‚Äôt want to deal with it for the rest of my life

[21-Apr-18 08:47 PM] josh#8811
I don't want you to either! I'm hoping that the medication will help a ton

[21-Apr-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Robert actually doesn‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm on medication

[21-Apr-18 08:48 PM] josh#8811
Why is that?

[21-Apr-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
They‚Äôre tranquilizers and only help with a couple of symptoms

[21-Apr-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
It only helps with auditory and paranoia (kind of)

[21-Apr-18 08:49 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, so did he say that being off meds is better?

[21-Apr-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
He told me it‚Äôs fine to stay on them, but he wants me to build up coping mechanisms before medication

[21-Apr-18 08:50 PM] josh#8811
That's a good plan too

[21-Apr-18 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because meds are just a piece of the puzzle, they aren‚Äôt a cure

[21-Apr-18 08:50 PM] josh#8811
Hmm, okay

[21-Apr-18 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
But isn‚Äôt that crazy? There‚Äôs a 70% chance that this will be chronic

[21-Apr-18 08:51 PM] josh#8811
That's crazy, we need to hang onto that 30% and hope and hope ‚òπÔ∏è

I know honey, but it‚Äôs not looking good. Robert wants to stay in touch through college

[21-Apr-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811
I'm expecting this to be chronic, but I do hope that it goes away

[21-Apr-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad you can keep in touch with him

[21-Apr-18 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
He wasn‚Äôt very upfront about my diagnosis or anything, but things like that make it seem like it‚Äôs worse than I thought

[21-Apr-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811
It's possible that it is, honey

I'm scared too, but I know that you'll be able to learn how to cope with it more, and I *promise* that I will be there to support you all the way

[21-Apr-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm just scared that it won‚Äôt go away. It hasn‚Äôt since the start of school

[21-Apr-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it‚Äôs just exploded

[21-Apr-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
And everyone but me knows the severity of it

[21-Apr-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because all of the adults hide it from me

[21-Apr-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811
I'm really sad that they hide it from you

[21-Apr-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811
And it's possible that it won't go away, but that doesn't mean that it won't improve, right?

[21-Apr-18 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I got Robert to be more transparent with me at the end

I hope so too

[21-Apr-18 08:56 PM] josh#8811
You did?

[21-Apr-18 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes. He got out a book full of all the mental disorders, and read through the definitions for me for diagnosis

[21-Apr-18 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
And he said that I don‚Äôt have full on schizophrenia *yet*

[21-Apr-18 08:57 PM] josh#8811
Uh oh, yet?

[21-Apr-18 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like, I‚Äôm in danger of getting it if this persists

[21-Apr-18 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Schizophreniform means you show signs but it hasn‚Äôt been long enough

[21-Apr-18 08:57 PM] josh#8811
Okay, so it's definitely possible that this could further develop

[21-Apr-18 08:58 PM] josh#8811
Before you told me this today, I thought it was 100% that this would be for life

[21-Apr-18 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just 70%

[21-Apr-18 08:58 PM] josh#8811

What's that?

Whenever I ask Ivonne about her mental state, she references videos I‚Äôve watched on disorders quite a bit

[21-Apr-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
Right okay

[21-Apr-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it‚Äôs not like a way to describe illnesses

[21-Apr-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like she takes their stuff and says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my stuff‚Äù

[21-Apr-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
What are you suspecting?

[21-Apr-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And quotes them word for word

[21-Apr-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
By the way I think I have the same suspicion

[21-Apr-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, like I think she has something obviously, but her stuff doesn‚Äôt really add up

[21-Apr-18 09:03 PM] josh#8811
Okay, please don't tell her this but the way her multiple personalities act make me suspect that she doesn't actually have the disorder

[21-Apr-18 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Omg that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard from a lot of people I‚Äôve told, especially Robert

[21-Apr-18 09:03 PM] josh#8811

There was a video from a news source interviewing someone with multiple personalities, and she said the same thing that they said

She probably has depression and some compulsive stuff

[21-Apr-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
Like, those childhood stories? The way she's described them so detailed and stuff also gives me suspicion too

Oh yeah definitely

Do you know that one personality, lucas?

[21-Apr-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think so

[21-Apr-18 09:09 PM] josh#8811
She said when he switched in or whatever, he found a dead squirrel and picked it up and stuff. That's when I seriously started to doubt things, because she also claimed that she can't see other personalities memories and there's no way that could happen

Ok go for it

[21-Apr-18 09:13 PM] josh#8811
When she talked to me about it, she said that she had multiple personalities. I remember we were walking down the back stairs of Everest one day when school got out, and she asked me to guess what personality she was at the moment. And this doesn't make sense now! I asked of it was the happy one, and I remember she said "no, it's the sporty one." She was wearing jogging shorts, and the way she described it then was that they were just a part of one person, not individual people. After that she said she wasn't going to talk about it again until towards the end of sophomore year when she brought it up and it was completely different

[21-Apr-18 09:13 PM] josh#8811
And Enno? The little kid? Explain to me how they can type...

[21-Apr-18 10:46 PM] josh#8811
I promise honey, it's okay that we haven't been able to talk dirty for the past couple of weeks. I'm just really happy that you still love me and are still attracted to me. When we are able to start dating I know that we'll be able to find some time to enjoy ourselves, but if you can't have that right now because of what you're going through, I completely understand and I'm not upset. We gotta put your health before my pleasure honey, and that's perfectly okay.

Also, I love you so much and I promise that I will never do anything to hurt you, especially go as far as being unfaithful. We share a really strong connection Hannah, and the thought of doing something sexual with anyone else but you just doesn't feel good or right at all. I feel so attached to you, I'm almost embarrassed about it. I think about our future a lot, and I feel like I want to spend my whole life with you. I do feel embarrassed saying it, but it's true; I think about it all the time, and it just feels right. I felt like I had to tell you at some point, that's how strongly I feel about us.

I know that we will be able to get through your schizophreniform. I'll always be here to help support you. If you feel scared during the night, I'll be there to wrap my arm around you and make you feel safe. If you're having a bad day, I'll make you a cup of herbal tea and give you everything you need to help you feel better. 

I feel like we already have a really strong connection with each other already, and I think that's a good sign, right? I won't let anything, even schizophreniform, stand in the way of my love for you. Whatever happens in the future, I promise that both of our lives will improve. I love you so much, sweet dreams üòö‚ô•Ô∏è

[22-Apr-18 08:55 PM] josh#8811
I was going to say that life is really stressful right now, and it probably will be for at least a couple more weeks, but as soon as we start learning how to deal with schizophreniform more and more then your life will start to improve

I guess it just depends on if it‚Äôs long-term or not. And because I‚Äôm sick, I think it‚Äôs going to last forever and I‚Äôm going to be miserable

She is leaning towards that diagnosis, I can tell by the way she talks about it

Maybe they don't know, but they're trying the protocol?

Probably, because it‚Äôs only when she is with my parents

[23-Apr-18 03:11 PM] josh#8811
I think the next time you see her you should ask her to be honest

[23-Apr-18 03:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok give me your unbiased diagnosis

[23-Apr-18 03:18 PM] josh#8811
From all the symptoms, it really sounds like schizophreniform to me. I've read personal schizophrenia experiences online, and a lot of them sound really intense (like, the psychotic episodes). So, this sounds like schizophrenia or schizophreniform, but not as strong. The thing that stands out to me the most is the voices; that's the biggest arrow here. You've gotta have a minor form of schizophrenia ‚òπÔ∏è

[23-Apr-18 03:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I think I have the onset symptoms, like it hasn‚Äôt progressed a lot yet

[23-Apr-18 03:18 PM] josh#8811
Yeah, exactly

[23-Apr-18 03:19 PM] josh#8811
I hope it doesn't progress much if it's going to

It's possible that I may have a one bedroom apartment during community college, I'm not sure yet but I think I'd live around 10 miles away

[23-Apr-18 09:15 PM] josh#8811
So even during the first part it won't be that bad

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it

[24-Apr-18 08:56 PM] josh#8811
Oof, well the only possibility is that when you upped your dosage that did something. Hopefully we'll see a difference when you go off all meds; in other words, I wouldn't dismiss it immediately but I wouldn't hold onto it either

[24-Apr-18 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay

[24-Apr-18 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
The thing is that I‚Äôve been at this dosage forever and it just started

Yeah, that's the thing

[24-Apr-18 08:56 PM] josh#8811

You have?

[27-Apr-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
It looks like you can't talk anymore tonight judging by the time (I started writing this at 10:12), but I hope you're sleeping well and I love you so so much! 
I think about you very often, and I know that we're going to get through this. I'll be your caretaker as well as your boyfriend honey, and I'll do my best to give you all the support that you need. 
I'm sad that you can't start college until January, but you definitely need that extra time to get back on your feet. I promise, you will be able to get that patient care that you need. 
I'm pretty sure that I'll be living in an Oakland apartment for my community college years. If I can make that happen, I can give you a key and you can come over any time you want to for any reason. It probably won't look the best inside because I know nothing about interior design (üòÖ), but it can be a nice place for both of us to relax in. 
All in all, I'm hoping and hoping that we'll have a good future together. It's really fun to fantasize about stuff like that, even if it's about an apartment. 
I'm going to do the best I can to care for you. Things are pretty scary right now, but they're going to get better. I'm in this for the long run, and I know that it will be hard but I love you so much, and I can't imagine not giving you support. 
Also, if I ever do something stupid or hurtful in the future, I am so sorry. Because of how my parents treated each other and how I treat them, I'm terrified that I'll slowly turn into an asshole towards you. Lol, do me a favor and dump my ass if I ever start treating you badly! You deserve an awesome life. Goodness, I better treat you like the wonderful person you are forever. 
I'm sending happy thoughts! It's okay if you can't reply or text, I completely understand. You do you honey, take the time you need and don't worry about me getting disappointed. Lol I'm sorry for the huge copypasta. 
I love you so much! Goodnight, sweet dreams üòö‚ô•Ô∏è

It‚Äôs so normal to me

Would you say that it doesn't bother you?

Because I can‚Äôt sit in one spot

[29-Apr-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
Ah, I see

I can clearly tell a difference between mania and depression

[29-Apr-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
They sound like polar opposites

[29-Apr-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I‚Äôm manic I believe I‚Äôm fine and everything is okay I‚Äôm just excited. When things are like they were today I believe that I should be hospitalized and that I should just stay inside

[29-Apr-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
Woah, that's a pretty big change in ideology

[29-Apr-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like yesterday I cried over being overwhelmed and I don‚Äôt want to be in outpatient, and now I think that I should be inpatient

Oh shoot, I'm sorry honey ‚òπÔ∏è

Half of me thinks everything is great and I should be in school, and the other is thinking that I should be hospitalized

Like part of me actually thinks I need to be hospitalized. Like I could go from being perfectly fine to thinking about hurting others within seconds

[30-Apr-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm not going down that path though, I can‚Äôt email my psychiatrist again

Do you feel like you may act on that?

One time I caught myself with my hands on rylees neck but I was able to stop

Yeah, true

[30-Apr-18 09:28 PM] josh#8811
If you think about it, it's not like those thoughts will progress since you're getting help right?

Yeah?

[30-Apr-18 09:31 PM] josh#8811
If or when you get those angry thoughts about me, is there anything I should do to help you if I know you're in that mindset?

[30-Apr-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
You‚Äôll tell. I‚Äôll get explosive within seconds. I‚Äôll just need time to step away and chill. Maybe take a bath or change into something comfy

[30-Apr-18 09:33 PM] josh#8811
Ah okay, I should give you space if that happens right?

[30-Apr-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes

[30-Apr-18 09:33 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[30-Apr-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
My mom comments on it and that makes it worse, so just step away and I‚Äôll chill out

[30-Apr-18 09:34 PM] josh#8811
Okay, thank you for telling me how to help

[30-Apr-18 09:34 PM] josh#8811
I get a little snappy at my mom or sister too sometimes, so I can sort of understand that mindset that envelopes you, just a little

[30-Apr-18 09:35 PM] josh#8811
I know it's not the same though

[30-Apr-18 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah for sure. I explode though, you will see a clear difference

I'm really sorry honey, there's a chance that I'll be asleep before you text me tonight

[01-May-18 07:37 PM] josh#8811
I have a 102¬∞ fever, and I feel pretty terrible

[01-May-18 07:40 PM] josh#8811
I woke up from a nap a couple hours ago and my brain was fried so it made me have auditory hallucinations before I cooled down

[01-May-18 07:42 PM] josh#8811
Before I fell asleep I was watching a horror movie review with screaming and stuff, and when I was waking up after I heard several male and female voices screaming, but it sounded like a recording because there was echoes

[01-May-18 07:42 PM] josh#8811
And it went on for a few minutes

[01-May-18 07:43 PM] josh#8811
When I'm delerious, my brain forces me to listen to random sounds that come out of nowhere, just inside my head and they sound like recordings or something

[01-May-18 07:46 PM] josh#8811
But it never freaks me out cause it doesn't sound real ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[01-May-18 07:46 PM] josh#8811
Anywho, I'm pretty exhausted and it's pretty possible that I'll be asleep soon

Honey I love you so much please know that

[04-May-18 06:41 AM] josh#8811
It's 6:40 and I had a dream so real that it woke me up and made me sad

[04-May-18 06:42 AM] josh#8811
I just gotta type it out so it can get out of my head and I can fall back asleep

[04-May-18 06:43 AM] josh#8811
And I first want to say that I feel terrible for having it, especially at this time where we are so close together

[04-May-18 07:00 AM] josh#8811
I dreamt that I was in a school to study in for the day, and I went to this random classroom. Alex and a few other Everest students were there, and they were all generally happy to see me. 
Alex said that you were actually here too, but were in the bathroom. That made me say that I should probably get going (I was nervous that you didn't want me to surprise you and I didn't know how you felt about us talking there, so I thought it was better to leave).
So as I got up to leave, and as I was starting across the large classroom you walked in.
(I know that this wouldn't happen, I'm sorry that you have to read this)
But something was wrong, you were holding hands with Sandee and it was like you guys were dating. When you saw me you stopped holding hands with her, and that confirmed what I thought, I guess. I walked out of the room trying to keep a straight face, but the emotions that I felt in that dream were so real that I'm still suprised. 
It made me realize, if I had to lose you I wouldn't know what to do. It's like you're a part of me, that's how emotionally attached I feel towards you. I love you, it would kill me if something like that happened and I'm sure that it won't. 
I feel pretty bad that I had that come out of nowhere, I mean, it's weird! I was just dreaming about this big school and walking around, and then boom. 
I think that dream stemmed from my guilt when it comes to us being together before you broke it off with Spencer. Maybe it was my brain showing me how it feels if that would happen to me. 
I'm really tired, I'm going back to sleep now but I love you so much and I hope that your day is awesome today. You are strong, and smart, and you're beautiful üòä. Please don't worry about this whole dream, I know it was fake and I just needed someone to tell that it happened so I could vent my emotions. I'm a little worried about you since you didn't text last night, I remember you said Thursday was the deciding day for treatment. I hope you're okay honey ‚ô•Ô∏è

[04-May-18 07:00 AM] josh#8811
Oh shoot this is long

[04-May-18 07:01 AM] josh#8811
-----if you're here and can't talk much don't read up, it's just a sad dream lol; I want to know what happened and if you're doing alright üòÖ-----

[04-May-18 11:43 AM] josh#8811
I'm sorry about the messages, telling you about the dream was probably a bad idea and I think you didn't like it

[04-May-18 11:45 AM] josh#8811
I wasn't thinking since I just woke up, but if it happens again I'll make sure to type it out somewhere else. I feel pretty guilty about it, please let me know if you want to talk about it and how I can help fix this

[04-May-18 11:50 AM] josh#8811
Do you know what the program will be like? I'm really happy that you finally are getting help, this is great news

Did you get a new piercing?

[04-May-18 02:33 PM] josh#8811
It's the ring one, right? I'm sorry if I don't recognize the new one, they all look really nice

[04-May-18 02:36 PM] josh#8811
Hehe that reminds me of how you told me around the same time last year how you were really excited to get this other piercing in your ear

[04-May-18 02:36 PM] josh#8811

I'm sorry I can't talk much, I'm still with my mom

[05-May-18 09:41 PM] josh#8811
We went to pick up my sister from a slumber party, and my mom brought up that I better be nice to my sister because when she's older she'll have friends that you will be interested in, and that grossed me out; even if I were single (thank goodness I have you in my life, I love you), she's like six years younger than me so ew! She's turning twelve this year. Nasty....

[06-May-18 09:10 PM] josh#8811
Oooh okay, those look nice! I have to admit, I'm relieved that you don't want the barbell. That looks like it would be painful hehe

[06-May-18 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it‚Äôs so annoying, it looks like it gets caught on everything!

[06-May-18 09:11 PM] josh#8811
Yeah! And tangled in hair and stuff

And just look at me. I just heard a zipper noise. I have horrible mood swings. And I know I have my period but this isn‚Äôt my normal

[07-May-18 10:21 PM] josh#8811
I know that it seems like you need to be hospitalized right now, but I promise that if you give yourself time to re-acclamate to school and have your outpatient therapy, your life will improve. I'm not good at looking into other people's perspectives and I know that my opinion will not be worth much since you're the one going through all of this, but I'm asking you to try and give yourself more time with the help that you have

[07-May-18 10:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay, I understand. It‚Äôs just so hard when you are living and experiencing it. I have reached my limit a long time ago

[07-May-18 10:23 PM] josh#8811
I know it's hard, it sounds very taxing. I cant imagine walking in your shoes. I'm sorry that you have reached your limit and I don't blame you

I think I'm going to go to sleep in a few minutes, I hope you sleep well and hopefully we'll cross paths at some point tomorrow. If we can't talk in the morning then I wish you luck on your AP test. Goodnight, I love you

[09-May-18 04:34 PM] josh#8811
I hope you're having a good day and that therapy is going well. I'm sorry that I didn't talk to you during the break, I was feeling really depressed. I'm happy that we were able to joke around a little bit before you left, and I promise that the next time we have the opportunity to talk to each other I'll actually approach you.

So either like manic depression, bipolar, one of those with psychosis stuff on top of it

[09-May-18 09:50 PM] josh#8811
That does make sense, yeah. Manic depression sounds a little off to me but it's possible, right?

[09-May-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Lol manic depression is another way of saying bipolar oops. I meant a mood disorder

[09-May-18 09:51 PM] josh#8811
Wait it is? Haha oops! I had no idea, I should have definitely known that by now. I get what you're saying though

I feel like if I was admitted to inpatient I‚Äôll be locked up in the looney bin

[09-May-18 09:59 PM] josh#8811
Well it sounds pretty controlling to me honey but I don't think you'd be locked up like what I'm imagining based on the term "Looney bin"

[09-May-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well the inpatient kids just had depression. How do you think the inpatient doctors would react if they saw my records?

[09-May-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
Only depression? Jesus, I'd easily be able to get in there if I had a record, and I'm afraid of thinking how they'd treat you

[09-May-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I‚Äôm not discrediting their feelings at all, I‚Äôm just saying that an outside source made them unstable. But imagine doctors seeing my symptoms. Dad said I would be sedated and stuff the entire time

[09-May-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
I think that's what would happen. You'd have to be on strong antipsychotics so that they'd be certain that you wouldn't harm anyone. I feel like the inpatient system in this country is not directed towards improving the patient but rather subduing them

[09-May-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
And I know you wouldn't harm anyone honey, even now

[09-May-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
That's just what they'd probably do

[09-May-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm more of a danger to myself than anything else

Well today during the test I briefly forgot where I was. Monday I crossed the street while cars were coming at me in both directions without even thinking about it

Shoot, I see what you mean. I didn't know that you forgot where you were, that sounds like a confusing experience and I'm sorry that you crossed the street without paying attention

[09-May-18 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn‚Äôt even realize it until nana yelled for me to stop walking

[09-May-18 10:06 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow

[09-May-18 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can get explosively angry but I can hold back right now

[09-May-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad that you can hold back. That takes a lot of self control, I used to have a lot of anger issues when I was younger

[09-May-18 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Mhmm, it‚Äôs difficult though. I get impulses to run away and stuff but I can resist it

[09-May-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I‚Äôll just get into a trance during an episode and just focus on my symptoms

[09-May-18 10:09 PM] josh#8811
I remember you told me that you had that impulse one day and you had to go to the lounge to help cope

[09-May-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs tough

[09-May-18 10:10 PM] josh#8811
It sounds very tough

[09-May-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
I don't think I've ever truly experienced what you're going through right now, and I'm sorry that I'm not able to help support you that well. I'm happy that I'm able to listen and I hope that I can someday help you with your problems even more. I'm sorry that you're going through this

[09-May-18 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs okay honey, you don‚Äôt have to apologize

[09-May-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811

Also sorry for being a little MIA, I impulsively deleted this app

[09-May-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
Why did you do that?

[09-May-18 10:16 PM] josh#8811
It's okay, you don't need to apologise. Thank you for telling me

[09-May-18 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone

[09-May-18 10:17 PM] josh#8811
Sometimes it's healthy to have some space and take some time for yourself. If you do this again, can you try telling me so that I know why I'm not hearing from you?

[09-May-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôll try my best to

[09-May-18 10:18 PM] josh#8811
Okay. I understand if you don't since it's an impulse, so don't feel like you have to

[09-May-18 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000

Hey honey, I hope you're doing olay and that you had a good night's sleep. I want to say that I love very much and I care about you a lot. I hope that your day goes well and that your therapy goes well with Robert

[12-May-18 09:00 AM] josh#8811
I just remembered, I had a dream about texting you. You got back from therapy with Robert and you said that he said it would be a good idea to ask about other people's feelings when they did stuff, it was really strange. Then I think you asked me if you could hear about how I felt and I said that was fine. I don't really know what the purpose of this dream is, it sounds like a weird strategy for you lol

[12-May-18 09:40 PM] josh#8811
Sorry this is random but we gotta try go karting together sometime, I went today and it was so fun. I've honestly never been into something as much as I was with it

I think it‚Äôs just scar tissue from when I was born

She said it‚Äôs not a tumor or anything like that

Well, all I can remember is that you and Rylee were in my kitchen with me, and I was crouching down on front of the fridge getting romaine lettuce for a salad we were going to make for some reason. And then, Rylee said something to me; I don't remember what he said, but it was small talk or just something in general and it was surprising because I didn't expect him wanting to talk to me. After we had our little exchange I felt happy, thats all I remember

Didn't she tell you that they do that regularly?

[15-May-18 12:03 AM] josh#8811
Okay I'm actually pissed off

[15-May-18 12:05 AM] josh#8811
Ivonne was saying she didn't care if Riley died (not your brother), and I said she should call in a police report to his address since he's a gun owner and tried to kill himself twice already. And you know what happened? People argued with me saying that Ivonne could get in trouble for that somehow, just look at the history in #venting. Unbelievable.

But yeah, I'm pretty pissed off about it

[15-May-18 12:09 AM] josh#8811
I feel like she got special treatment. There really shouldn't be any debate about calling the police if someone is genuinely going to try to kill themselves

It kind of shows how flawed our group mentality is

[15-May-18 09:28 PM] josh#8811
I agree, nobody even backed me up. I was pretty shocked at how people reacted, considering the guy already tried to kill themselves twice before and had the potential to do so again

[15-May-18 09:29 PM] josh#8811
I don't know, yeah

[15-May-18 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd think when someone was introduced with that information, they‚Äôd call the police

[15-May-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
I'd think so too

[15-May-18 09:30 PM] josh#8811
It just makes sense to

[15-May-18 09:31 PM] josh#8811
It reminds me of that time that ivonne said she convinced someone to commit suicide

It helps with delusions and I think it could really help her

[15-May-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811
I think so too, she should at least try it out

[15-May-18 09:43 PM] josh#8811

Yeah and I‚Äôm not saying it in a demeaning way, I just think that serious therapy could help

[15-May-18 09:45 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad you're not, and I agree with what you think. She really needs more than just talk therapy if she even tried that in the first place

[15-May-18 09:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think if real psychiatrists saw her she‚Äôd be inpatient

[15-May-18 09:46 PM] josh#8811
Yeah, for sure. Especially if she talked about her hallucinations and altars and all of her self harm stuff

[15-May-18 09:46 PM] josh#8811
I call bs on the hallucinations though, I'm pretty sure

[15-May-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
The hallucination she described to me was right out of a YouTube video of a real schizophrenia patient

[15-May-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
What did she tell you?

[15-May-18 09:48 PM] josh#8811
God, that's actually disrespectful. I remember on the last day of school last year she was talking about hallucinations as we all walked to the park (I'm not sure if you were there), and she pointed to a telephone wire and asked if anyone else saw birds there. She also talked about seeing shadows I think

[15-May-18 09:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
She‚Äôs a psychopath with Munchausens

[15-May-18 09:49 PM] josh#8811
Yup!

[15-May-18 09:49 PM] josh#8811
I started doubting her baggage last fall

[15-May-18 09:50 PM] josh#8811
Did all of that school fighting ring stuff even happen?

[15-May-18 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Trust me I‚Äôve done so much research, and everything she‚Äôs told me was from YouTube videos

[15-May-18 09:50 PM] josh#8811
What a discrace lmao

[15-May-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think she had a predisposition to get an illness, and childhood trauma made it kick in

[15-May-18 09:51 PM] josh#8811
That's definitely possible

[15-May-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
It's hard for me to believe all of her trauma though, like all of the fighting at school

[15-May-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
When she wrote it out in that Google doc it sounded fake

[15-May-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000

[15-May-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811

Yeah, all of the lies about disorders is pretty much begging for some sort of help right?

[15-May-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
She‚Äôs desperate for validation and self worth

[15-May-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
I guess she only thinks she can get comfort and love from friends if she guilts them into it

[15-May-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[15-May-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000

I saw a snippet of her real personality one time

[15-May-18 09:55 PM] josh#8811
What was that like?

[15-May-18 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
We were playing the game of life and I was being silly, and I made her laugh so hard she cried

[15-May-18 09:56 PM] josh#8811
That sounds really heartwarming thinking about it

[15-May-18 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000

Yeah...

[15-May-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
I do feel angry for all of the lies she's said, but it's not like she's doing it just to be a bad person. She's stuck in a rut and she genuinely needs help

[15-May-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
She is suffering and sadly we can‚Äôt help

They took two voices at high and low pitches and pasted them over each other

Bipolar people don‚Äôt have hallucinations that coincide with mood changes

Do schizophrenic people have that?

Well my mood kinda circulates on how my hallucinations are. Bipolar people just have mood cycling, and that is separate from psychosis

I don't think so and if you did I'm sorry for forgetting

[16-May-18 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I at least told you we were tapering off of it

[16-May-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
I don't remember that at all, the last time you talked about Zoloft you said that your mom thought it was causing the problem and you said that on April 24th

[16-May-18 10:26 PM] josh#8811
Is that when you started tapering it off?

[16-May-18 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Weird I could‚Äôve sworn I told you. I stopped quite recently. It wears off in about 5 days and I stopped for at least 3. It‚Äôs fuzzy since the hydroxyzine and Valium

[16-May-18 10:28 PM] josh#8811
Huh, weird. I'm very sure you didn't tell me, if not then I'm losing my memory. Thank you for telling me

I‚Äôm super tired so quick update: eeg went ok I guess. The strobe lights hurt me but I was able to nap. Now we wait for results. I got super sticky, crispy hair afterwards from the electrode glue which was nasty. Dad also made me walk around Stanford mall right after which was greatt. At least I got a new adidas sweater! I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted. Dad told me he knew when I fell asleep during the appointment because I make the same face as I did when I was a baby. Goodnight, I love you so very much.

Well I was in the chicken coop with Ivonne and everyone else was right outside it, and Ivonne was holding a chicken already but I was trying to get one. So, I bent over and I guess my rear was facing Nico and everyone else and I think he said something along the lines of that my butt was a trailer or something? And he repeated it after I asked what he said, and I responded with "oh my god! Jeez man don't point out my butt" or something similar

Okay I was an idiot and stayed up way too late tonight, I'm probably going to be pretty tried tomorrow ‚òπÔ∏è. I love you very much ‚ô•Ô∏è

[21-May-18 03:23 PM] josh#8811
Hey I just want to say I had a lot of fun with you today and I'm really grateful to be able to sit next to you and have you in my life because you make me feel happy

[21-May-18 05:10 PM] josh#8811
I really missed talking to you in person, it made my day

[21-May-18 07:35 PM] josh#8811
Also I forgot to tell you that you look really cute today

Do you know what I found out

[21-May-18 08:52 PM] josh#8811
What did you find out?

[21-May-18 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm not eating as much as I should

[21-May-18 08:56 PM] josh#8811
What do you mean?

[21-May-18 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
I started tracking my food, and I‚Äôm missing out on like 1000 calories

[21-May-18 08:58 PM] josh#8811
Oh Jesus, wow

[21-May-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
That's a lot

[21-May-18 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
And guess the craziest part!

[21-May-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
Hmm?

[21-May-18 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm gaining weight because my body is grabbing onto whatever it can get

[21-May-18 08:59 PM] josh#8811
Oh no!

[21-May-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
It must be storing food as fat for later

[21-May-18 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Totally. So I‚Äôm sneaking in more fruit and bars

[21-May-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Okay, that's good

[21-May-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
What bars do you eat?

[21-May-18 09:00 PM] josh#8811
Make sure it doesn't have corn syrup, that's high in fructose which the liver turns into fat

[21-May-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cliff bars

[21-May-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
Also avocados have a good amount of calories too

[21-May-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
I'll check those out

[21-May-18 09:01 PM] josh#8811
They should be okay though

[21-May-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I love avocados, I eat a ton of that and mango

[21-May-18 09:02 PM] josh#8811
Yay! They have good fat in them, I should eat them more

I‚Äôm working on it!

I know! It's okay, I know your diet will get better

I‚Äôm gonna have tofu for breakfast tomorrow

[21-May-18 09:04 PM] josh#8811
That's great! Lots of protein

[21-May-18 09:05 PM] josh#8811
Please make sure that it's organic though; legumes such as soybeans absorb herbicides easily

Don‚Äôt worry we are good about that

Yay üòÖ

[21-May-18 09:06 PM] josh#8811
I'd recommend looking into the ketogenic diet since it's so low on carbs, but it may be hard to follow because you're vegan

[21-May-18 09:07 PM] josh#8811
And I'm really glad that you caught on to this and decided to change it, thank you for telling me

[21-May-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt want a diet. I‚Äôm already following a specific plan

[21-May-18 09:11 PM] josh#8811
Good point, you do you; I'm sorry for suggesting it

[21-May-18 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs okay

[21-May-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
But honey, during school days I‚Äôll usually eat a handful of trail mix and maybe a bar. Then I‚Äôd be snacky all day and go to chips instead of something filling. That‚Äôs not good!

[21-May-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I won‚Äôt even eat breakfast

[21-May-18 09:12 PM] josh#8811
Oh jeez!

[21-May-18 09:13 PM] josh#8811
Do you at least a full meal for dinner?

[21-May-18 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes. Dinner was my only meal

[21-May-18 09:13 PM] josh#8811

Today was the first day I really ate lunch during expeditions. Like a full sandwich lunch

I'm proud of you, that's great that you ate a full sandwich!

I have a bit of an eating problem, I'm not sure if it's as severe

[21-May-18 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have body dysmorphia like my mom, so I eat less than is healthy because I thought it was normal. But then I rapidly gained 10 pounds!

[21-May-18 09:16 PM] josh#8811
Do you think that's why you gained weight, the eating less?

[21-May-18 09:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, because I‚Äôve had this problem for the longest time

[21-May-18 09:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Since the start of this school year

[21-May-18 09:17 PM] josh#8811
I'm very sorry to hear about your eating problem

[21-May-18 09:17 PM] josh#8811
Do you pack fruit?

[21-May-18 09:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now I eat a ton. I‚Äôve been eating a mango every day

[21-May-18 09:17 PM] josh#8811

Oh also, I never ate fruit and only ate a bit of broccoli at dinner. Now I eat fruit every day and I splash in peppers, peas, lettuce, carrots, etc

[21-May-18 09:19 PM] josh#8811
That's really good!

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
So, you don't eat a full meal in the morning, right?

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
Is it because you don't have enough time to make one?

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not unless my mom made something like French toast

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
I skip breakfast pretty often but I'm working on it

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
Ah, I see

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] josh#8811
I'd recommend to wake up 30 minutes earlier so that you can make something substantial

[21-May-18 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I should prep breakfast the night before

[21-May-18 09:21 PM] josh#8811

[21-May-18 09:41 PM] josh#8811
I feel like I'm alright, I mean I've stayed around 135lbs and gained back the weight I lost when I got sick. I just have bad eating habits when it comes to scheduling

Maybe just set a reminder on your phone so it doesn‚Äôt get too late

I will, don't worry

[21-May-18 09:42 PM] josh#8811

Aww honey why are you anxious

[21-May-18 09:44 PM] josh#8811
Well I was an idiot and drank a coca cola around 4pm, and I'm worried about completing my tri fold for independent study in time and I'm also worried about your dieting, and everyone is planning the prom outing right now so I guess I have stuff on my mind

[21-May-18 09:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Take a deep breath and step away from everything. Maybe take a shower. Then deal with the things that are stressing you out from most to least important

[21-May-18 09:46 PM] josh#8811
Okay, thank you for the advice; I appreciate it

[21-May-18 09:46 PM] josh#8811
I've done all I can for my independent study project tonight, I'll just have to get some work done tomorrow

[21-May-18 09:47 PM] josh#8811
I'm hoping you can let me know how your eating habit goes as the week progresses so I know how you're doing

[21-May-18 09:47 PM] josh#8811
And I don't really know what to do about the prom thing, I'll figure it out I guess

[21-May-18 09:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Honey just please know that I‚Äôm not intentionally starving myself. I just have an unhealthy relationship with food that I need to work on

[21-May-18 09:48 PM] josh#8811
I know, and I'm very happy that you aren't doing that. I'm very relieved that you took the initiative to work on your food relationship

Ok so I was going down a YouTube hole and got to mental illnesses, which led to the suicide squad movie, and then somehow got to musically. And you know what I can‚Äôt stand? A combination of those things. Tell me if I‚Äôm overreacting but I found so many videos of them mocking the line where Harley Quinn was referencing voices inside her head. And they were acting all crazy

I'll just type out the dream so you can read it when you can, I'd love to hear yours when you can type it as well

[24-May-18 11:45 AM] josh#8811
So I had several connected ones, you were in all of them

[24-May-18 11:48 AM] josh#8811
The first one I remember is that we sat at a table at school across from each other and I think Nico was perpendicular to us at the same table. We were playing footsies too, but I think we stopped at some point. Then Nico starts telling me about how he saw a funny greentext (usually slightly vulgar stories from 4chan) and I think you got jealous because you chimed in and said something hehe

[24-May-18 11:50 AM] josh#8811
Okay, so the second one was that we were in plt and the girl to my right stood up and started playing a super shitty annoying song on her phone, and she held it up high and was blasting it to annoy everyone. And I got pretty mad, I told her to turn it off and sit down. Then I stood up and a different girl took my wallet! That pissed me off so much, I think I yelled at her lol. And then this different girl started doing something to annoy me but I don't remember what it was; anywho, she bent over and I told you to take her wallet and you did and got in trouble üòÇ

[24-May-18 11:51 AM] josh#8811
And the last one is pretty sad, it woke me up

[24-May-18 11:54 AM] josh#8811
So it was lunchtime but we were all in a different school, like one where there's lunch tables that are super long and have the seats attached. I walked up and everyone was sitting on the right side, but you were sitting on the left side and so was Spencer, and he was like five feet away from you and around 10ft away from everyone else so he was isolated. I sat on the right side so that Spencer wouldn't text your mom, and I saw that you were crying. Then Spencer got up and tried to kiss you but you were faced away from him so he kissed your hair and walked away, and I had no idea what to do because I didn't know if I could approach you or not, and I was so stopped up from the dream that I woke up

I got up to record Maja's song today and I turned around for a second and saw you with your mom and when I was recording I thought she was judging me or something and I didn't know how to act, because she never sees me you know?

I feel like I accidentally tricked myself into detaching our relationship online from our relationship in real life, like online I'm talking to one person and in real life in talking to a different one. I'm really scared of talking about this because I don't want to make you upset and I don't know if anything good would come from it so please tell me if we should change the conversation or say goodnight

[24-May-18 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000

I'm going to sleep finally, I hope you are getting some good rest. I love you with all my heart!
I think it would be a good idea if we had a conversation tomorrow about how both of us feel about the approaching summer; I know you said that it's scary for both of us, and that's true. I think talking about our feelings some more would really help, and I'm hoping to understand how you feel too. I really want to be able to be with you in person after you turn eighteen, but I think it would be better if we talked about when you think we can start dating so that we both have a good connected mindset and so that I understand your boundaries too. I love you, goodnight üòö‚ô•Ô∏è

Oh also Jess would like to be called Claire as her permanent name, I thought it would be good if you knew that

[27-May-18 01:15 AM] josh#8811
"yee, I sorta just picked Jessica a long time ago because I really admired a cousin with the name and wanted to be like her I guess. So I sort of picked it for a childish reason and it‚Äôs better to have my own name independent from her. After thinking about it for a while I‚Äôm goanna go with Claire. Jess / Jessica is still a cool name but it‚Äôs nice to have something that my parents like too (since they thought it was weird since my cousin already had the name by total coincidence right???)

Hehehe lemme take a look

[28-May-18 09:23 PM] josh#8811
Alright well I'm seeing grey in both, but I read online that women have more color receptors so I could be wrong üòÖ

[28-May-18 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok let me rephrase it. These pictures were both taken in the bathroom at the same spot, just at different distances. Is the shirt more grey or more purple? I‚Äôve noticed that at some points it looks darker, while at times it looks like a light grey

[28-May-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
Ohhhhh, okay

[28-May-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
Let me take a moment to think about that haha

[28-May-18 09:26 PM] josh#8811
I can't see any purple in that first photo myself, but it definitely looks darker

[28-May-18 09:27 PM] josh#8811
Does that answer the question? Idk haha

[28-May-18 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm genuinely confused because I don‚Äôt know the true color

[28-May-18 09:29 PM] josh#8811
Hmmm, have you ever worn it to school?

But it could be actually, we must have different color stuff? I can definitely see it's darker

[28-May-18 09:32 PM] josh#8811
It's like a darker grey, with like the slightest twinge of blue?

[28-May-18 09:32 PM] josh#8811
I'm not sure about the blueness even

[28-May-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
But what is it? Light or dark grey

[28-May-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
The ladies who sold it called it purple, but it looks like light grey hmm

[28-May-18 09:33 PM] josh#8811

[28-May-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000

Because I‚Äôm tired of being asked if I‚Äôm okay, if my heads doing good. I‚Äôm tired of this dominating my life. I mean, there‚Äôs more to me than this, but it‚Äôs clouded over

[29-May-18 09:49 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like this has affected your relationships with others a lot, and I wish that it didn't cause people to view you differently to the point where you're agitated. I hope that it stops clouding over soon; it's possible that people will adjust, but that can take time

Meredith stood up and said she appreciated the whole friend group, naming everyone including me, and she said we really helped her through a tough time. She's been trying to talk to us more during the trip

I'm sorry that we couldn't talk, but  I love you so much! Today has been fun, but stressful too; Meredith attaching herself to the friend group is giving me stress, and I think something's up with Ivonne because she's been more touchy. I talked with her tonight and she's staying with Alex during college, so I'm very happy to hear that. Nico's backed off after I yelled at him to stop when he said he wanted to eat my ass on front of everyone, but I don't think that will last for long really. 
On the upside, the dam and the city are beautiful! I had lots of fun taking photos and hanging with my friends. 
I'm very sorry that you couldn't come honey, but I promise we can do something like this during college with our friends. We won't have to worry about hiding our relationship then, too so it will be a lot less stressful. I love you with all my heart!

I don't really care but I just thought you should know since we're together, and I think she did it on purpose for some reason just to get a kick out of it; like sometimes she purposefully says stuff and then takes it back

Oh yeah!

[05-Jun-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I got a maybe diagnosis

[05-Jun-18 09:51 PM] josh#8811
For what may I ask?

[05-Jun-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Schizoaffective disorder

[05-Jun-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
Huh, okay

[05-Jun-18 09:52 PM] josh#8811
Is that replacing the possible bipolar ii or is it added to it?

[05-Jun-18 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
So the diagnosis needs a major mood disorder (bipolar) and schizophrenia-like symptoms

[05-Jun-18 09:53 PM] josh#8811
Ah, I see

[05-Jun-18 09:54 PM] josh#8811
So if you're officially diagnosed you'd probably also have a bipolar diagnosis, right?

[05-Jun-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
There‚Äôs a bipolar version and depression version

[05-Jun-18 09:55 PM] josh#8811
Oh, okay

[05-Jun-18 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
So it‚Äôs basically the love child of bipolar and schizophrenia

[05-Jun-18 09:56 PM] josh#8811
Oof

[05-Jun-18 09:56 PM] josh#8811
Hehe cute couple ;p

Oh yeah üò¨

[05-Jun-18 09:57 PM] josh#8811
How are you feeling about your potential diagnosis?

[05-Jun-18 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean it‚Äôs not awesome but it makes sense

[05-Jun-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
Yeah, that's true

[05-Jun-18 10:00 PM] josh#8811
I'm happy that at least it's leaning towards a diagnosis

[05-Jun-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it makes sense because it encapsulates the mood swings of bipolar and the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia

[05-Jun-18 10:02 PM] josh#8811
Yeah! I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be smart but I was suspecting you somehow had both bipolar and schizophrenia for a while

[05-Jun-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think they made up this disorder because you technically can‚Äôt have both diagnoses

[05-Jun-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
Huh, interesting

[05-Jun-18 10:03 PM] josh#8811
I hope you can get diagnosed soon honey

[05-Jun-18 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Me too. I‚Äôm trying to do the math in my head as to what makes sense when it comes to chemicals in my brain

[05-Jun-18 10:08 PM] josh#8811
Yeah?

[05-Jun-18 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
So anxiety and depression is lacking chemicals. But the Zoloft helped normalize and then went too far and freaked my brain out. Schizophrenia is an excess of those chemicals. Bipolar is either lack or excess of chemicals

[05-Jun-18 10:10 PM] josh#8811
Huh, interesting

[05-Jun-18 10:11 PM] josh#8811
Maybe you have an excess then?

[05-Jun-18 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe the Zoloft overdid it with my brain and sped up the alteration of my chemistry. That‚Äôs what my mom says

[05-Jun-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811
Oh no üò¨

[05-Jun-18 10:13 PM] josh#8811
Shoot, is there any medication to reverse that? That's terrible

[05-Jun-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt think we can reverse it, but the medication I take now helps

[05-Jun-18 10:15 PM] josh#8811
I'm really glad it helps honey

[05-Jun-18 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Me too

[05-Jun-18 10:16 PM] josh#8811
I mean, it's possible that the change will slowly reverse over time if that's the case

[05-Jun-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
We were thinking that I was born with a tendency to go down this route, and that the Zoloft triggered mania

[05-Jun-18 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
So too many chemicals happening

[05-Jun-18 10:18 PM] josh#8811
Ouch

In some way yes. The medication has helped stabilize my mood because it chills me out, but my hallucinations have changed

I bet you it was that stupid Zoloft. I probably was bound to have it trigger in my mid 20s, but it made things worse

I'm sorry if I've acted aloof today. I feel depressed and angry when I see you in person, to the verge of tears sometimes. I can't stand the fact that we haven't talked to each other directly or acted like we even know each other because we can't, or you don't want to. I feel broken and trapped because I don't want to leave you but I also can't put up with how I'm affected each time we see each other

[09-Jun-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why?

[09-Jun-18 11:04 PM] josh#8811
Well, I'm at my dad's right now and he wanted me to 'formally and directly' invite everyone in the house at the moment (so his wife, him, and my sister), and I did during dinner. I said "I'm inviting everyone to come, although I am indifferent about the event as it doesn't mean too much to me". And then he asked *who*. So I had to say everyone by name to make it clear I was also inviting his wife. She later indirectly said that if I didn't want her there I should say something by comparing it to how she told her mom that she didn't want to invite many distant relatives to her wedding, and I had to explain to her again that I felt indifferent about whether anyone came because I didn't care about the graduation and it just made everything awkward because she let out an audible gasp, and then it started a small argument between her and my dad because I was already very clear on not going weeks ago. Just idk...

I've been very emotionally erratic these past few weeks. I don't know if it's the situation we're in with your family, my fear of the future, or more, but I'm driving myself up the wall and I know it's probably effecting you in some way and I'd like to apologise and explain myself. 
Throughout the day, my feelings about our situation change so drastically and rapidly. Panic, anger, hope, fear, resentfulness, relief, gratefulness, and more emotions rush through me on a daily basis when I think about you. I have so many thoughts about you that rush through my head every day. *How are we going to make this relationship work in the long run with your family's opinion on me? Am I going to be able to soldier through the pain of not being by your side until January? Am I too attached to you, and do you not like that?*

[09-Jun-18 11:58 PM] josh#8811
I don't know how you are feeling, but I am extremely worked up about our relationship. It's all I can think about. As soon as I feel like I've lost control of our relationship and it's heading in a different direction, I panic. I can't live without you Hannah, but I'm also having trouble living like this. I would be crushed if you left me, but I am in a lot of pain because of how we can't have a real romantic relationship until next year. And, there's nothing we can do about it. Literally nothing short of telling your parents, which isn't an option.
All we can do is soldier on, and it makes me very angry. Just because of some stupid decision I made in November made it impossible for us to have a deep emotional connection and brought our limits down to talking through texts and slight physical exchanges. Do you remember the last intimate sort of communication we had? You intentionally bumped into me during lunch and later asked me online if I appreciated it.

[09-Jun-18 11:59 PM] josh#8811
I want to scream; this is torture for me. I love you to death, but this situation is killing me. And there's nothing I can do but vent about it because it won't change.
I'd like to apologise. I'm sorry for acting like a dick sometimes. I can't control myself when my emotions are running rampant and I don't know what to do but apologise. I'm doing my best to work on myself, but I'm just so angry and depressed because I can't even talk to you in real life. 
I'm sorry that it has to be like this, and I'm sorry that I'm not a better person. 
I'm sorry that you had to read this and I'm sorry if it made you feel bad, especially right before graduation which is a shitty move on my part

[10-Jun-18 12:01 AM] josh#8811

[10-Jun-18 10:41 PM] josh#8811
I feel the same way to be honest; it's hard for me to maintain my emotions for you when we have to act like we barely know each other. It makes me really sad because nowadays I only imagine situations where we go out or hug to keep me going

I don't want to keep you trapped in an intimate relationship where it's hard for you to maintain it; I do feel a lot of pain considering what you're asking for, but I know it's probably for the best at this point since we can't date

[10-Jun-18 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, it‚Äôs gonna be 7 months of literally no interactions

[10-Jun-18 10:45 PM] josh#8811
Yeah

[10-Jun-18 10:46 PM] josh#8811
I'm not interested in pursuing any other romantic relationships in between now and February, I'm just making that clear

[10-Jun-18 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay. Plus I really feel like I need to get myself figured out and stable before committing myself to a relationship since I‚Äôm a lot to handle

[10-Jun-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
Alright, I understand that. I want to let you know that I am more than willing to help support you in February

[10-Jun-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Than you. I mean, Robert told me I need to focus on getting myself better before dating again during a session recently

[10-Jun-18 10:49 PM] josh#8811
Robert's probably right

[10-Jun-18 10:50 PM] josh#8811
Dating takes work

[10-Jun-18 10:50 PM] josh#8811
Can I still be there for you at least as a support system and a friend during now and even during February if you're not ready to date yet?

[10-Jun-18 10:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Of course

[10-Jun-18 10:50 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[10-Jun-18 10:51 PM] josh#8811
I'm afraid you'll find someone else or something

[10-Jun-18 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Don‚Äôt get me wrong josh, you have been such a valuable and supportive person in my life and I‚Äôm so grateful for that

[10-Jun-18 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt go outside

[10-Jun-18 10:52 PM] josh#8811
I'm glad that you think of me that way

[10-Jun-18 10:53 PM] josh#8811
My understanding is that we're pretty much putting this part of our relationship on a pause, correct? I really don't want to be with anyone else and I'm planning on continuing a relationship with you during college. Is that what you were thinking as well?

[10-Jun-18 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah just pulling back on the reigns a bit

[10-Jun-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
Alright

[10-Jun-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
I'm sad that this is happening but I know it's for the best. We can't see each other because of your family so it's already hard

[10-Jun-18 10:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm very sad about it too. But I truly think it will hurt less than trying to put all of our energy in whatever we are doing online

[10-Jun-18 10:58 PM] josh#8811
I think so too

[10-Jun-18 10:59 PM] josh#8811
Can we still talk every day? As friends? I am okay with turning off this intimate aspect, but I am still very attached to you and I think maintaining that part of our relationship (talking frequently) is important so that we are more comfortable with each other in February

[10-Jun-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes of course. I‚Äôm not telling you to go away lol

[10-Jun-18 11:00 PM] josh#8811
Phew I was worried üòÖ

[10-Jun-18 11:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just want to limit the stress and worry that came with trying to maintain a relationship online

[10-Jun-18 11:03 PM] josh#8811
I think it's a good idea. Like, every time we have talked my worry that you don't want this anymore has lingered in the back of my head and it's easier because now I don't have to worry about maintaining our affection for each other

[10-Jun-18 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I obviously still care about you very much, but it‚Äôs sad and tiring because we can‚Äôt see each other in person

[10-Jun-18 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can‚Äôt constantly worry about that while I‚Äôm trying to get better

[10-Jun-18 11:05 PM] josh#8811
It's not healthy. I still care about you very much as well, and I hope you can get better soon

[10-Jun-18 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Jun-18 11:05 PM] josh#8811

[10-Jun-18 11:06 PM] josh#8811
I still have pretty strong feelings for you

[10-Jun-18 11:07 PM] josh#8811
I'm sure I will for a long period of time

Once I get to saint marys we can revisit that stuff

[10-Jun-18 11:08 PM] josh#8811
Okay, cool

[10-Jun-18 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know you love me and care about me, and I want that more than anything. It‚Äôs just rough now so I want to wait until I get to college

[10-Jun-18 11:11 PM] josh#8811
I want it terribly, but I agree with you. You're going through a lot and your family isn't into the idea, so it's better for both of us if we wait

I‚Äôm really sorry we had to have this conversation. It was never my intention to make it seem like I didn‚Äôt like you or make you sad. I came to this decision with the best intentions

[10-Jun-18 11:14 PM] josh#8811
It's okay, I'm glad we talked about it. I know you never meant to cause me harm, it's alright. I'm glad you came with best intentions

I'm finally going to sleep now. I'd like to thank you again for initiating the conversation; I am glad that we were able to come to a common understanding for the summer. I know that these next few conversations we have will be a little awkward, but I'm prepared for that and I know we'll be fine soon. I'll talk to you tonight, cya

[11-Jun-18 09:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm very confused and I‚Äôm being manipulated by my own brain, so it is hard for me to deal with things. The one thing I‚Äôm sure about is that some space will help you and make you hurt less, as well as give me time to recover

[11-Jun-18 09:38 PM] josh#8811
Okay

[11-Jun-18 09:38 PM] josh#8811

Alright, I understand that. I'll talk to you later?

[11-Jun-18 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why do you keep saying later when we are talking now

[11-Jun-18 09:45 PM] josh#8811
Well, your first message mentioned space and it confused me because I thought you wanted space

[11-Jun-18 09:45 PM] josh#8811
So I thought you didn't want to talk anymore, I'm sorry for the confusion

[11-Jun-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
I meant I need like less intimacy right now because it takes a lot of effort and it isn‚Äôt really on my mind anyway. It‚Äôs hard for me to lay in bed and be attentive when I‚Äôm terrified of my surroundings

[11-Jun-18 09:48 PM] josh#8811
Ah I'm sorry, I didn't understand that was what you meant. I'm sorry that you can't be attentive because of what you're going through, and it's perfectly okay that we have to change that aspect of our relationship. I'm sorry for the confusion

[11-Jun-18 09:49 PM] Deleted User#0000

Hey, sure you've pulled back a bit but we all still like you a lot; you're going through a rough time and it sounds like it's hard to maintain friendships. I wish I knew how to reassure you more

[13-Jun-18 10:48 PM] josh#8811
I know you feel that way but please believe me that your friends understand why you've had to give less and less of your attention. A terrible friend would not give their attention because they don't care enough; you are the opposite of that because you want to be a better person in that place. I'm very sorry that you have to spend so much energy working on yourself

Alright, I'll continue to be patient with you. I appreciate you talking to me about this more too, thank you. It's perfectly okay if you can't give your all some nights, I understand. It breaks my heart when I'm not with you as well

Because my parents said that I was really withdrawn

It went alright, thank you for asking. Alex Ivonne and Maja met up with me for a small friend group hangout. I thought it went okay, but I wish more people were able to come since some flaked and others were busy

At least they were able to hang out though, 3 is better than none

Yeah, true. It was fun

Do you still feel the same way you did last night about where our relationship should stand?

I want more than anything to be with you

[14-Jun-18 10:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
I also am very wary of my actions and impulsivity though

[14-Jun-18 10:32 PM] josh#8811
I want that too, it's painful. I do need to say that when our relationship goes through quick changes like they have in the past, it's pretty emotionally taxing on me and I don't like those quick changes as they cause a lot of pain and confusion, whether the space changes from more to less or vice versa

[14-Jun-18 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm very sorry about that

Yeah, I‚Äôm sorry for being so back and forth. I don‚Äôt have a lot of self control

[14-Jun-18 10:39 PM] josh#8811
Thank you for apologizing, I understand that it's not just because of your self control though. This relationship we have is pretty restricted, and it's hard to judge what is the right thing to do. I'm hoping that when we can see each other in person our relationship is more stable

[14-Jun-18 10:40 PM] Deleted User#0000

But you deserve the world and all I can do is feel bad for myself

Honey, you deserve the world too. All I can do right now is try and improve your quality of life through online support, please don't feel bad that you can't give me what you think I deserve

Sometimes you just need to take the time to vent it out

I just cause extra trouble for myself

[14-Jun-18 10:54 PM] josh#8811
I think that happens to everyone, but now that you are trying to heal from what you have been going through it's harder to take the time to think about the decisions you make

It‚Äôs okay, literally no one knows what I‚Äôm going through

[15-Jun-18 11:21 PM] josh#8811
What's your theory?

[15-Jun-18 11:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
There‚Äôs something the creators do that cause people who play it to become addicted to it. Everyone who I‚Äôve seen talk about their time playing it had said that they were in too deep

[15-Jun-18 11:22 PM] josh#8811
Oh wow, huh

[15-Jun-18 11:23 PM] josh#8811
Maybe it's because it's an escape to a world more under the player's control?

[15-Jun-18 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think for me it‚Äôs like I can play out my fantasies and experience things that I can‚Äôt in real life

Huh, interesting

[15-Jun-18 11:25 PM] josh#8811

Rylee totally disagrees with me, but Dwight has to be my favorite character. He has so many great moments

[17-Jun-18 11:45 PM] josh#8811
I agree, he's so good

[17-Jun-18 11:45 PM] josh#8811
He was just üëåfrom episode 1 with hitting the pencil wall jim built

Yesss. Harper and Rylee are so basic with their character choices

I do like the occasional rallying Pam does for office activities though

I'm really scared for your future because of what you told me about your periods of unresponsiveness throughout the day. I'm hoping that you tell Robert about it tomorrow; can you tell me what he thinks about it? 
Also, this is just a small suggestion but I think it might be good if you ask your mom about buying CBD Oil for you. My little sister has been taking it and it's completely alleviated her from her frequent migraines, and I've recently read some scientific studies suggesting that it helps with the symptoms of psychotic disorders. 
Please let me know how your therapy goes, and I'd appreciate it if you got back to me about the CBD oil too because it might help. I hope your day goes well tomorrow and I love you

[18-Jun-18 09:33 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry, I'm can't talk until pretty late (~12) because I'm hanging out with Mason, I hope you are doing okay if we don't talk and I love you

[19-Jun-18 11:46 PM] josh#8811
Purisma is so funny

[19-Jun-18 11:47 PM] josh#8811
Like, broccoli is good but I had no idea a cat would like it

[21-Jun-18 10:33 PM] josh#8811
Hi! I'm sorry, I was doing the dishes. How have you been?

[22-Jun-18 12:04 AM] josh#8811
I just finished a very long conversation with Ivonne

[22-Jun-18 12:05 AM] josh#8811
She messaged me saying she was going to commit suicide tomorrow, thinking that I would understand because of my history of depression last year and how bad it got

[22-Jun-18 12:05 AM] josh#8811
I quickly made a group chat including everyone I knew was available to talk (Maja, Alex, James, Claire) and some of us talked to her for a while

[22-Jun-18 12:06 AM] josh#8811
She's going to message me as soon as she wakes up tomorrow, and I'm going to try and meet with her as well

[22-Jun-18 12:06 AM] josh#8811
God, it was terrible

[22-Jun-18 12:06 AM] josh#8811
I'm sorry, I'm venting

[22-Jun-18 12:07 AM] josh#8811
I'm really scared about what is going to happen

[22-Jun-18 12:08 AM] josh#8811
If she doesn't get help soon then she's going to actually try to commit suicide

[22-Jun-18 12:09 AM] josh#8811
Looking back, she messaged me around 8pm talking about how Alex didn't want to see her but she'd see him on Monday

[22-Jun-18 12:09 AM] josh#8811
So, when she messaged me at 10:45 that means she started planning it right beforehand

[22-Jun-18 12:12 AM] josh#8811
Shit I figured it out

[22-Jun-18 12:13 AM] josh#8811
She was going to jump on front of a train

[22-Jun-18 12:14 AM] josh#8811
She asked about train timetables and whether we'd be in rwc

[22-Jun-18 12:15 AM] josh#8811
I gotta sleep this is too much

[22-Jun-18 12:56 AM] josh#8811

[23-Jun-18 08:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Any updates?

[23-Jun-18 10:52 AM] josh#8811
Hey that's okay

[23-Jun-18 10:53 AM] josh#8811
I made her promise to not try anything while I'm in LA because we are going to meet up afterwards

[23-Jun-18 10:54 AM] josh#8811
She did visit the train station just to check it out and then said that they don't move fast enough

[23-Jun-18 10:54 AM] josh#8811
I'm really stressed out about it

[23-Jun-18 10:55 AM] josh#8811
The reason that she's so stressed out and is suicidal is because of her living situation; her family is pretty much abusive

[23-Jun-18 10:55 AM] josh#8811
And that worries me *a lot* because she's not moving out until she finishes community college

[23-Jun-18 10:58 AM] josh#8811
So, I feel like this is inevitable unless we do something

[23-Jun-18 11:03 AM] josh#8811
The only thing I can think of that would help is having her share a two bedroom apartment with me because we're both doing community college. 
However, that honestly could feel awkward, and I'm worried as to how that could affect my relationship with you since I'd be living with a girl that's not my partner

[23-Jun-18 11:03 AM] josh#8811
So I feel that's completely off the table unless all three of us have a serious conversation about it

[23-Jun-18 11:07 AM] josh#8811
But yeah, I guess talking to her helped a little and I'm overall very worried because I'll be out of town

[23-Jun-18 01:54 PM] josh#8811

Yes tell me lol

[27-Jun-18 11:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was supposed to get my blood drawn. It was one where I had to fast, so I was hungry. I chewed sugar free gum on the way there, and the lady sent me home! It had less than five calories!

[27-Jun-18 11:02 PM] josh#8811
Wtf, that's so stupid!

[27-Jun-18 11:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
She said I can only drink water or black coffee. I think coffee does more to the body than a piece of gum does

[27-Jun-18 11:03 PM] josh#8811
Yeah I think so too

[27-Jun-18 11:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Anyways I was really upset because I have to do it tomorrow

Gosh, I hope it goes alright and you don't get kicked out again üòñ

I‚Äôll probably go right after I wake up

[27-Jun-18 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah did I tell you about the psychiatrist?

[27-Jun-18 11:05 PM] josh#8811
Nope

[27-Jun-18 11:05 PM] josh#8811
What happened?

[27-Jun-18 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
So now I‚Äôm taking 300 mg consecutively. she said if that didn‚Äôt help (of course it didn‚Äôt) we‚Äôd add on a mood stabilizer, like lithium.

[27-Jun-18 11:07 PM] josh#8811
Hmm, okay

[27-Jun-18 11:07 PM] josh#8811
As I said before I know a girl with bipolar that lithium helped her with

[27-Jun-18 11:08 PM] josh#8811
Hopefully either of those two things will help you

[27-Jun-18 11:08 PM] josh#8811
How are you feeling about it?

[27-Jun-18 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well everything has transitioned so I‚Äôm more in my head I think, like emotional instability and spacing out

[27-Jun-18 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope lithium helps with that

[27-Jun-18 11:09 PM] josh#8811
I hope so too

[27-Jun-18 11:10 PM] josh#8811
I know that even if it doesn't, you will find something that will; I mean, it's bound to happen right?

[27-Jun-18 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, but the other medications will make me super hungry or super tired

[27-Jun-18 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
So it‚Äôs like oof

[27-Jun-18 11:11 PM] josh#8811

[27-Jun-18 11:11 PM] josh#8811
That's pretty stupid

[27-Jun-18 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm reaching 400 mg on my seroquel dosage, so we can‚Äôt go much higher on it

[27-Jun-18 11:13 PM] josh#8811
What other medications are you taking besides that? You said you started 300mg, was that Seroquel?

[27-Jun-18 11:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, that was it. The other things I take are magnesium and vitamin D

[27-Jun-18 11:14 PM] josh#8811
Okay

So I‚Äôm not on any anti depressant or anxiety medication

Right, okay

[27-Jun-18 11:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which is interesting because I thought depression would always be persistent, but it isn‚Äôt at all

[27-Jun-18 11:16 PM] josh#8811
Oh yeah, it's true

[27-Jun-18 11:16 PM] josh#8811
Most people that have depression go through a period of it

[27-Jun-18 11:16 PM] josh#8811
Like how I did

[27-Jun-18 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, but I can‚Äôt take an antidepressant so I‚Äôm happy I don‚Äôt have to deal with it

[27-Jun-18 11:17 PM] josh#8811
I'm happy too!

My ocd has come back a bit but it adds character so whatever

[27-Jun-18 11:17 PM] josh#8811
What do you mean?

What sort of things?

[27-Jun-18 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like walking, how I have to do it a certain way. I also have to check my room to make sure no one is walking around

[27-Jun-18 11:19 PM] josh#8811
Huh

You do?

Is it just once, or multiple times?

Hey, I just want to let you know that I am completely committed to my relationship with you; I'm not interested in seeing or doing anything with anyone else because you told me that we should keep being affectionate over the summer. I'm sorry if that Jaime thing made it sound otherwise; I should have said in the moment that I don't want to break my faithfulness to you, on top of how I wouldn't even think of sending nudes to anyone else. 
I'm really hoping that we can meet up sometime now that we have more freedom, but I know it's hard for you for several reasons. I feel like classical conditioning has kind of kicked both of our asses, to be honest. I feel like I'm trained to ignore your physical presence and I really want that to change. And, I feel like you've over time become really scared of your mom finding out about us even talking, even though she said it was fine. That's just my perspective here. 
Please let me know if you don't feel the same way about how our relationship should be. Yeah, it hurts when you ask for space but I really just want you to be honest with me about your feelings if you haven't been already. I feel like we should talk about this more, and probably every so often so that we both know where our relationship is heading during the summer and college.
I really, really hope that your new dosing works and I would like to hear updates about how you're feeling too. I'll talk to you soon, and I'm thinking of you

Preventing her suicide I guess; I told Alex Maja and Claire that one night and ever since she's been pissed off at me. I wanted to meet with her to check in but she said she didn't want to

[03-Jul-18 10:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I‚Äôd personally rather her hate you and be alive than dead

[03-Jul-18 10:40 PM] josh#8811
I feel the same way

[03-Jul-18 10:41 PM] josh#8811
I just feel sad that our relationship had to change like that because of how she feels

[03-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I get that, but you gotta look at the big picture

[03-Jul-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
No, I understood that this would happen; she's done it before and I am always willing to sacrifice our friendship to keep her alive

[03-Jul-18 10:43 PM] josh#8811
Last time she cut me off for a few days because I said that I'd call the police, after like 30-35 minutes of trying to convince her

Sorry, just to clear things up with the "getting too invested," I'm not interested in her if that's what you were talking about; I have you and you have me, right? I don't want anyone else, I'm 100% committed to this relationship

[03-Jul-18 11:33 PM] josh#8811
I love you

[03-Jul-18 11:37 PM] josh#8811
I know I've been depressing at times about our relationship but, I really want to keep this going and I don't want to lose you

You mean a lot to me and you're always on my mind

[03-Jul-18 11:38 PM] josh#8811
I'm sorry for being negative about our situation

[03-Jul-18 11:39 PM] josh#8811
I'm just scared for our future I guess, but I now realize that the best thing we can do is keep it positive and I know that I haven't been doing that, which I regret as I know it's made you feel bad

[03-Jul-18 11:40 PM] josh#8811
Please tell me if I need to change anything about how I treat you, I'm sorry for how I've been and I hope I can change for the better

My weekend was supposed to be at least partially fun with a movie meetup with James and Maja, but on the way I got a flat tire and even if I didn't, they both cancelled on me while I was on my way so that was sort of a bummer. I managed to walk to my moms and get my bike fixed today though, so that's good at least

Look, I've done some thinking and I feel like it's best if we either sit down and have a long conversation about our relationship concerning both now and for the future, or just go our separate ways instead. It's your choice. 
Every few months, the nature of our relationship changes, and my emotions can't take that plasticity without me feeling a lot of pain for an extended period of time. You've altered our relationship (taking the love and romance out of it) this way four times. As Michael Scott would put it, "you have no idea the physical toll that three, ~~vasectomies~~ pretty much break ups, have on a person."
I'm not saying that I don't love you anymore; I still do. This is just too painful for me and I don't feel like it's worth it because of how you've acted about our relationship. Something like this is bound to happen again if we ever have a long distance relationship in college, from my perspective, because of how four have already happened in the span of less than a year. I'm very angry about it. It's honestly driving me  crazy. This time, you didn't even directly initiate it (you said you were very busy) and the fact that I was already able to derive what you wanted from your implications through that message and then other texts bothers me, a lot. Every time we've started saying our "I love you" messages again, I don't trust that it will last. I've been right so far.
Just to conclude things I guess, tell me what you want to happen: we can either have a long serious conversation about what's going to happen relationship-wise, or we can go our separate ways and just be friends, permanently. I'm very tired of this happening to me and I need things to change.

[08-Jul-18 11:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm very sorry about everything. I just started seeing things in a more realistic way I guess. We can‚Äôt stay fantasizing and hoping about something that may be - especially if we cannot be together. Continuing to just text is tiring and detrimental to a relationship, and I don‚Äôt want to continue dragging you through the dirt when it‚Äôs unrealistic. I‚Äôm very sorry

[08-Jul-18 11:41 PM] josh#8811
Ok

[08-Jul-18 11:42 PM] josh#8811
God what a clusterfuck honestly

[08-Jul-18 11:46 PM] josh#8811
I'll back off now

[08-Jul-18 11:46 PM] josh#8811
I think we still need to talk about a couple of things

[08-Jul-18 11:46 PM] josh#8811
Are you still there?

[08-Jul-18 11:47 PM] josh#8811
I want to make sure we're both on the same page about everything

[08-Jul-18 11:48 PM] josh#8811

Okay, gotcha same here

[08-Jul-18 11:50 PM] josh#8811
So, we're just friends now correct? Do you want space? Should we still talk as often as we have?

[08-Jul-18 11:50 PM] josh#8811
Like, I understand your feelings now but I didn't get any direct statements

[08-Jul-18 11:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wish it didn‚Äôt have to be this way, but cannot devote all of myself to you. I hope you take this in the best way, I want to be with someone my parents enjoy being around

[08-Jul-18 11:52 PM] josh#8811
Gotcha

[08-Jul-18 11:52 PM] josh#8811
I don't blame you; you have a good relationship with your family

[08-Jul-18 11:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I cannot predict the future, so we have that I guess. But for now I want to focus on making myself better. I‚Äôm a mess honestly, you wouldn‚Äôt want to hang out with me in person anyway

[08-Jul-18 11:54 PM] josh#8811
Trust me, I'd do anything to see you right now but it's fine. Let's keep in touch! Want to keep talking every night, or do you want to tone things down?

[08-Jul-18 11:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôd love to keep talking, we still click pretty well. I don‚Äôt want to have strict schedule, like every other day or something. How about when it feels natural?

[08-Jul-18 11:56 PM] josh#8811
Sure, sounds like a good idea

[08-Jul-18 11:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Okay

[08-Jul-18 11:57 PM] josh#8811
I'll be honest, I'm still a little hopeful for our future as you just said, but I think this is probably the best way to go

[08-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs best I think so we don‚Äôt feel that constant pining or desperation to be together

[08-Jul-18 11:58 PM] josh#8811
Yeah, exactly

[08-Jul-18 11:59 PM] josh#8811
I'm pretty angry at your mom for shutting me out here; let's hope she doesn't do that to the next guy you're with
